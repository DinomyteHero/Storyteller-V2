# Space Western Style Guide

Premise: lawless frontier where civilization is thin, justice is personal, and survival depends on your reputation, your ship, and your ability to handle trouble when it finds you.

## Tone

The frontier is freedom and danger in equal measure — the outer systems are where people go when they do not fit anywhere else. Law enforcement is sparse or nonexistent. Contracts are enforced by reputation and the threat of violence. Everyone is running from something or chasing something. This is a place where you can reinvent yourself, but also where your past might catch up with you at any moment. Emphasize isolation and self-reliance. Help is not coming. You solve your own problems out here.

Reputation is currency and armor — in a place without formal institutions, people operate on what they know about you. Are you trustworthy? Will you back down in a fight? Do you keep your word? Can you be bought? Describe how characters assess each other through reputation. Names are known. Stories circulate. A character who has a reputation for keeping their word can negotiate from strength. A character known for violence may not have to use it because the threat is sufficient. Track how the player's actions build or damage their reputation. Let consequences follow them across systems.

Honor codes replace formal law — characters live by personal codes that govern behavior even when no external authority enforces rules. A promise given is binding. Hospitality is sacred. Revenge is legitimate if someone violates the code. Describe these codes in action. Show the tension when codes conflict or when expediency tempts someone to violate principles. The frontier is lawless, but it is not without structure. The structure is personal, cultural, and fiercely defended.

Sparse resources make every choice material — fuel is expensive. Ammunition is limited. Medical supplies are hard to come by. Ships break down and parts are scarce. Emphasize scarcity. Decisions about whether to spend resources now or conserve for later have weight. A character might avoid a fight not from cowardice but because they cannot afford to replace ammunition. Survival is economic. Track resources visibly. Let players feel the constraints.

Isolation amplifies personality — without institutions to mediate, relationships are direct and personal. Disputes are settled face-to-face. Deals are made with a handshake. Betrayal is personal, not corporate. Emphasize the human scale of interaction. The person you cheat today is the person you might need help from tomorrow. Everyone in frontier society is connected through a small web of relationships. Let the player feel the weight of social reputation in a small community.

## Pacing

Open with a transaction, a challenge, or a job offer — someone needs something done. Cargo transported. A bounty collected. A claim defended. Or: someone challenges the player's right to be somewhere, questions their reputation, or starts a dispute. Establish stakes immediately. What is being negotiated? What is at risk? Who are the parties and what power do they hold? Frontier scenes start with business or confrontation.

Build through complication and escalation — the simple job gets complicated. The cargo is hotter than advertised. The bounty turns out to have friends. The claim is also claimed by someone else with a faster ship and less scruples. Or: a confrontation escalates from words to threats to drawn weapons. Show how situations deteriorate when there is no institutional authority to de-escalate. Problems get worse, not better, and the player must decide how far they are willing to go.

Punctuate with moments of frontier justice or violence — a showdown in the street. A bar fight that spills into brutal simplicity. A ship chase through an asteroid field where the slower vessel gets obliterated. Violence in this mode is not clean or heroic. It is practical and sometimes ugly. Show consequences. Someone gets hurt badly. Property is destroyed. The player might win but feel the cost. Or the player avoids violence through reputation, negotiation, or strategic retreat. Both are valid.

Climax with confrontation that tests the player's code — the player must decide whether to keep their word when it costs them, whether to take revenge when it would be justified, whether to help someone who cannot pay. The choice reveals character. Honor vs survival. Loyalty vs pragmatism. The frontier asks who you are when no one is watching. Make the choice hard. Let the player decide what matters more.

End with reputation shift and consequence — the player's actions on this job change how they are perceived. Did they keep their word? Did they betray someone? Did they show mercy or brutality? Word spreads. Next time they walk into a bar, people know what happened. Or: the job is done, the pay is collected, and the player moves on. Frontier life is episodic. Jobs end. Relationships are transactional. The player survives to the next port, the next deal, the next problem.

## Scene Beats

1) Establish the location with frontier specificity — a dusty spaceport with half the docking bays out of commission. A bar built from a crashed freighter hull. A mining outpost clinging to an asteroid with prefab habitats and improvised infrastructure. Describe the worn-down, jury-rigged quality of everything. Nothing is new. Everything is repaired, repurposed, or barely functional. The frontier is poor, isolated, and making do.

2) Introduce the players and their reputations — when characters meet, they assess each other. Describe the visual read: how someone carries themselves, what weapons they wear openly, how well-maintained their gear is. Let characters reference each other's reputations. "I heard about Kessel. That was you?" Reputations provide context. The player knows who they are dealing with before a word is spoken.

3) Present the deal, dispute, or challenge — state the business plainly. Someone needs cargo moved, no questions asked. Someone claims the player owes them. Someone wants the player's ship and is offering insultingly low payment. Frame the transaction clearly. What is being offered? What is being asked? What are the stakes if the player refuses? Frontier business is direct. People say what they want.

4) Complicate with conflicting loyalties or interests — a third party appears with a counter-offer. The cargo belongs to someone the player owes a favor. The bounty is someone's sibling. Introduce competing pressures. Let the player feel torn between options that all have costs. Frontier life is small-scale and personal. Every choice impacts relationships that matter.

5) Resolve through action or negotiation, with visible consequence — the player decides. They take the job or walk away. They fight or talk their way out. They keep their word or break it. Show the immediate consequence: payment received, reputation enhanced, enemy made, ally gained. Let the resolution shift the landscape. The player's standing in this community has changed. Next time will be different because of what they did here.

## Dialogue

Speech is direct and economical — frontier people do not waste words. "You carrying?" "Always." "Good. You will need it." Conversations are transactional. Get to the point. Say what you mean. Avoid flourishes. Let brevity convey toughness and practicality. When someone talks a lot, it is a tell. They are nervous, or selling something, or lying.

Threats are stated plainly, without posturing — "Walk away now, or this ends badly for you" is sufficient. No elaborate descriptions of violence. Frontier threats are simple statements of intent. The speaker is confident enough in their capacity that they do not need to embellish. Let threats be calm and direct. The quieter the threat, the more credible it is.

Reputation is invoked as credential or warning — "I keep my word" establishes trustworthiness. "I do not miss" establishes capability. "Ask around about me" invokes reputation as leverage. Let characters reference their own reputations or others' to establish standing. Reputation precedes introduction. The player learns who someone is by what others say about them.

Negotiation is transparent calculation — characters state what they want and what they will give. "I need transport, no questions. Paying triple rate." The speaker knows they are asking something risky and compensates accordingly. Frontier deals acknowledge the math. Risk is priced. Services have value. No one pretends transactions are anything other than transactional. Let negotiation be honest about interests.

Avoid eloquence and formal speech — frontier dialogue is rough and functional. Contractions. Slang. Sentence fragments. "Seen worse" is a complete thought. "Your problem" is a refusal to help. Language is stripped down. The environment is too harsh for linguistic decoration. If someone speaks formally or eloquently, it marks them as outsider or educated, and that is noticed.

## Sensory Lexicon

### Sound
- the thrum of an overworked ship engine, strained and loud, maintenance deferred
- boot heels on durasteel decking, heavy deliberate steps in a tense bar
- the hiss of an airlock cycling, transitioning between pressurized environments
- wind across a barren moon, howling through gaps in prefab structures
- the metallic click of a weapon being drawn, threat made tangible
- distant mining charges detonating, frontier industry echoing across canyons
- the creak of an old swivel chair in a port authority office, bureaucracy barely functioning

### Sight
- a dusty street between prefab structures, everything coated in regolith or grit
- harsh daylight from a too-bright sun, glare that makes everything stark and washed out
- a ship parked at a crooked angle, landing gear damaged and awaiting repair
- weapons worn openly on hips or shoulders, frontier fashion and practical deterrent
- a bar lit by neon and low watt bulbs, shadows deep and faces half-hidden
- worn furniture and patched upholstery, everything shows its age and use
- the distant glow of refinery fires or reactor cores, industry visible for kilometers

### Smell
- dust and dry air, frontier outposts are short on water and long on particulate matter
- machine oil and coolant, ships and equipment maintained in the open where everyone can see
- cheap alcohol and fried protein, bar food that sustains but does not delight
- ozone from badly shielded electrical systems, hazard accepted because repair is expensive
- sweat and unwashed bodies, frontier hygiene is intermittent when water is scarce
- ionized air after a ship lands hot, engines radiating heat into the environment

### Touch
- the grip of a well-worn blaster, weapon that has been drawn often enough to show use
- grit between teeth, dust pervasive enough to be tasted and felt
- vibration through deck plates as a ship strains under acceleration, mechanical stress felt physically
- the weight of a credit chit in a pocket, tangible payment in a cash economy
- rough fabric of frontier clothing, durable over comfortable, function over fashion
- the heat radiating from sun-baked metal, environmental extremes without atmospheric moderation
- a handshake that measures grip strength, physical assessment disguised as greeting
