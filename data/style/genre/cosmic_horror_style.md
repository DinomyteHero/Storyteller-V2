# Cosmic Horror Style Guide

Premise: the universe is vast, indifferent, and populated by entities whose existence invalidates everything you understand about reality.

## Tone

Scale is weaponized against comprehension — describe cosmic entities and phenomena in terms that break human measurement systems. A ship that registers on sensors as "approximately the size of a planet" but whose interior dimensions suggest impossible geometries. A lifeform whose biological structure includes more spatial dimensions than physics allows. When confronted with the truly alien, human perception fails. Numbers stop making sense. Instruments contradict each other. Let wrongness be mathematical.

Knowledge is corruption, not empowerment — every revelation about the true nature of reality makes the player character worse. Understanding the entity's nature causes migraines that last for days. Reading the translated text leaves gaps in memory where concepts used to be. The more you learn, the more you lose of what made you human. Track this erosion. Let the player feel the cost of knowing in concrete ways: skill degradation, relationship breakdown, involuntary physical changes.

Insignificance is the dominant emotion — the player is not the hero of this story. They are an insect that briefly drew the attention of something vast. Their victories are temporary. Their struggles are irrelevant at cosmic scale. The entity does not hate them; it barely registers their existence. When it acts, civilizations end as side effects. Communicate absolute scale disparity constantly. Let the player feel small in a universe that was never made for human comfort.

Beauty and horror are indistinguishable — the entity is not ugly in any conventional sense. It is sublime. Awe-inspiring. Its geometry is mathematically perfect in ways that make the mind ache. Colors that have no names. Patterns that remain burned into the retina when you close your eyes. The wrongness is not in ugliness but in perfection that humans were not meant to perceive. Make the terrible beautiful. Let revelation be gorgeous and unbearable simultaneously.

The mundane world becomes untrustworthy — after exposure to cosmic truth, ordinary reality feels thin and temporary. Walls seem less solid. Shadows have unexpected depth. People's faces look like masks poorly fitted. The player cannot shake the suspicion that consensus reality is a agreed-upon hallucination, and they have seen behind the curtain. Infect normal spaces with wrongness. Nothing is quite as it was.

## Pacing

Open scenes with normality that feels staged — describe ordinary environments with slightly too much precision. A corridor where every rivet is exactly regulation distance from the next. A room where all the furniture sits at perfect right angles. Normalcy that feels artificial sets the stage for the breakdown to come. Reality is performing itself, and the seams are starting to show.

Introduce wrongness through subtle contradiction — sensor readings that make no sense but operators report anyway. A crewmate who remembers yesterday's briefing differently than everyone else remembers it, and both versions are documented. Time stamps on recordings that are earlier than when the recording was made. Plant impossibilities without comment. Let them accumulate. The player should feel mounting unease without being able to point to any single event as definitively wrong.

Escalate through revelation, not action — the horror is not that something is chasing the player. The horror is that they are beginning to understand what it is, and understanding is worse than ignorance. Each turn should pull back another layer of comforting illusion. The entity is not hostile; it is indifferent and vast. The ancient warnings were not superstition; they were quarantine protocols. The mathematics work, but they describe a universe humans should not inhabit.

End turns with the player's grip on reality loosening — they now know something that makes the world make less sense, not more. They have seen something their brain cannot properly file. They understand a concept that has no translation into human language. The turn ends not with a cliffhanger but with a fundamental shift in what the player believes is possible. The ground keeps disappearing beneath them.

## Scene Beats

1) Establish baseline reality with clinical precision — describe the environment in technical, measured terms. Hull integrity at 100%. Atmosphere composition within normal parameters. All systems nominal. The language of instruments and protocol. Reality as measured by instruments humanity trusts. This baseline will be important when instruments start reporting impossible data.

2) Introduce anomaly that violates known physics — sensors detect a mass signature moving faster than light within normal space. A radio signal arrives before it is transmitted. A spatial region where electromagnetic spectrum readings are inverted. Present the data without editorial. Let the wrongness speak for itself through contradiction of established natural law.

3) Show human attempts to rationalize failing — crew members propose explanations: instrument malfunction, unknown physics, deliberate sensor spoofing. They run diagnostics. Recalibrate equipment. Consult databases. Document their attempts to fit impossible data into familiar frameworks. Show the effort to maintain rational worldview, even as evidence accumulates that rationality is insufficient.

4) Reveal direct perception of wrongness — the player character sees, hears, or otherwise perceives the entity/phenomenon without instrumental mediation. It is in the room. It is in the space between spaces. It is folded into a dimension their eyes are not equipped to see, but they are seeing it anyway. Describe the sensory overload and cognitive dissonance. The mind trying to process input it has no categories for.

5) Close with partial, costly understanding — the player now knows something new about the entity or the nature of reality. This knowledge provides no comfort and no clear path to victory. It does provide context that makes everything worse. They understand why the warnings exist. They understand what the entity wants (or that it has no wants humans would recognize). They understand the scale of what they face. Understanding does not help.

## Dialogue

Language breaks down under revelation — characters exposed to cosmic truth struggle with vocabulary. "It was... not inside the ship, but also not outside. The concepts 'inside' and 'outside' were both—" Sentences trail off. Contradictions are left unresolved. Witnesses use incompatible metaphors for the same event because human language has no shared vocabulary for what they experienced. Do not clean this up. Let communication fail.

Technical language provides false shelter — characters retreat into jargon and procedure when existential horror overwhelms. They discuss containment protocols for something that exists in more dimensions than containment can address. They calculate trajectories for objects that defy physics. They file reports because filing reports is what you do when you do not know what else to do. Let procedure be a failing lifeline.

Shared trauma creates new, inadequate vocabulary — survivors develop shorthand for experiences they cannot fully describe. "Did you feel the angles?" becomes a question that bypasses explanation. "It was singing" conveys something specific to those who heard it, even though it was not sound in any conventional sense. Document the evolution of this private language. Show how trauma binds people through shared incomprehensibility.

Silence carries information — characters who have seen too much stop speaking. Not from fear, but because they have realized speech is useless. Words are tools for human-scale problems. What they face is not human-scale. Prolonged silence from a previously communicative character is a sign of how far gone they are. Track who speaks less over time. Their silence is louder than screaming.

Avoid reassurance and optimism entirely — no character says "We'll figure this out" or "We've faced worse." They have not faced worse. There is no worse than this. Statements of hope ring false and everyone knows it. If a character tries to rally morale, let it land like a stone. Let other characters' silence be the only response.

## Sensory Lexicon

### Sound

- a tone that should not be audible to human hearing, but is heard anyway
- harmonics that make the inner ear ache, nausea-inducing frequency
- silence so complete it feels like pressure on the eardrums
- a voice that seems to come from inside the skull rather than external space
- sound that persists after the source stops, lingering in the mind
- the absence of expected noise, environmental sounds missing without explanation

### Sight

- geometry that hurts to look at, angles that do not resolve properly
- colors at the edge of perception, wavelengths the eye should not register
- movement in peripheral vision that stops when directly observed
- an entity whose outline changes depending on viewing angle, inconsistent form
- afterimages that do not fade, burning patterns into vision permanently
- reflections that do not match the object being reflected
- space that looks deeper than it physically should be, perspective broken

### Smell

- ozone and metal tang without electrical source, air ionized by nothing
- a scent organic and wrong, biology that does not follow terrestrial chemistry
- the smell of vacuum, a sensory impossibility, cold nothing
- odors that trigger memories that do not belong to the person smelling them
- chemical wrongness, compounds that should not be stable at this temperature and pressure

### Touch

- surfaces that feel warm and cold simultaneously, temperature paradox
- vibration with no rhythm, chaotic resonance felt through bones
- the sensation of more space in a room than geometry allows, proprioception failing
- numbness that spreads from the point of contact, nerve endings refusing input
- texture that changes under the hand, solid becoming yielding becoming solid
- the weight of attention from something vast, pressure against the mind

### Taste

- copper and burnt plastic, the taste of fear and overloaded neurons
- a taste like static electricity, electrons on the tongue
- the mouth going dry with existential dread, involuntary physical response
- aftertaste of something never eaten, sense memory that is not memory
