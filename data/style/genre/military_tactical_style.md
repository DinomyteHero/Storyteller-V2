# Military Tactical Style Guide

Premise: precise execution under fire, where every member of the squad matters and mission success demands perfect coordination between imperfect humans.

## Tone

Professionalism is the baseline — these are trained soldiers performing dangerous work with practiced competence. They use correct terminology, follow protocols, maintain equipment, and know their roles. The tone is not gung-ho heroism but workmanlike execution. Soldiers do the job because it is the job, not because they are individually exceptional. Competence is collective, earned through repetition and trust. Show respect for professional military culture without glorifying war.

Squad cohesion is survival — the individual operator is capable, but the squad is effective. Members know each other's rhythms, cover each other's sectors, communicate in shorthand built from shared operations. Trust is operational, not sentimental. You trust your teammate to check their corner because you have seen them check corners a hundred times. Emphasize interdependence. No one succeeds alone. Casualties are not just emotional losses; they are tactical degradation.

Information dominance drives decision-making — the squad with better intel, better communications, and better situational awareness wins. Sensor data, recon reports, command updates, and direct observation inform every choice. Describe what the squad knows, how they know it, and what they are still blind to. Commanders assess threat profiles. Operators read terrain. Every decision is made with incomplete data, but professionals gather as much as they can before committing.

Equipment matters as much as courage — a squad is only as effective as their gear allows. Ammunition counts. Battery life on sensors. Quality of armor. Reliability of comms. Track equipment state. A jammed weapon is not a narrative convenience; it is a mechanical failure with tactical consequences. Show the relationship between soldier and tool. Maintenance is not glamorous, but it is the difference between mission success and catastrophic failure.

Risk is calculated, not reckless — operators do not take unnecessary chances. They assess angles of fire, cover, fields of view, escape routes. They balance mission objectives against casualty risk. Sometimes the bold move is correct. Sometimes the cautious move is correct. The player should feel the weight of tactical decisions. Second-guessing is normal. After-action analysis is how professionals improve. Show the math of violence.

## Pacing

Open with mission briefing and preparation — establish objectives, terrain, known threats, Rules of Engagement, and commander's intent before boots hit ground. Let the player absorb the plan: squad roles, fire teams, rally points, contingency protocols. Preparation creates investment. The plan will not survive contact, but having a plan focuses action. Show the squad checking gear, reviewing maps, synchronizing chrono.

Execute the opening phase cleanly — the squad moves with practiced coordination. Point man advances, covering sectors. Comms discipline is tight. Movement is by bounds: one element covers while another moves. Everything works as trained. Establish competence first. Let the player see the squad operating smoothly so that when chaos arrives, the contrast is clear. Professional execution builds confidence.

Introduce friction and adaptation — contact with the enemy, unexpected terrain, equipment failure, civilian presence, Rules of Engagement complications. The plan adapts. The squad shifts roles, adjusts fire sectors, calls for support, or executes contingency. Show decision-making under pressure. Operators fall back on training, but also exercise judgment. Static adherence to plan gets people killed. Tactical flexibility keeps them alive.

Escalate through accumulation of tactical problems — ammunition expenditure, wounded squad member, lost comms with command, enemy reinforcements, time pressure from approaching secondary objective. Problems compound. The squad is still capable, but margins narrow. Every decision costs something. Extract or push forward? Treat the wounded here or move them under fire? Spend ammunition now or conserve for exfil? Show the operational calculus getting harder.

End turns with mission outcome and cost — objective secured or failed, casualties sustained, resources expended, intelligence gathered. After-action assessment is not melodrama; it is tactical review. What worked. What failed. What to adjust for next time. Professional soldiers debrief. Let the turn end with the squad counting cost and incorporating lessons. Progress is measured in objectives, not glory.

## Scene Beats

1) Establish tactical situation with map-level clarity — terrain features, known enemy positions, friendly locations, objective markers, danger zones. Use compass bearings, clock directions, and distance estimates. "Hostiles at your two o'clock, fifty meters, behind the low wall." Give the player a mental map. Situational awareness is foundational. Confusion about where things are creates frustration, not tension.

2) Assign roles and sectors — who has point, who covers rear, which fire team takes left flank. The squad divides responsibility. Each operator knows their job. Describe this division clearly. "Chen, you have primary breach. Vasquez, cover the door. Parker, watch our six." Role clarity allows coordinated action. Chaos happens when sectors overlap or gaps appear.

3) Present the tactical problem — enemy position, obstacle, time constraint, civilian presence, Rules of Engagement restriction. What is preventing simple execution? Why is this not straightforward? A dug-in machine gun nest. An IED-laden approach. A hostage situation. Frame the problem in tactical terms. The squad must solve this using their training, equipment, and judgment.

4) Execute with friction — the plan works, but not cleanly. Suppressing fire is effective but chews through ammunition. The breach charge blows the door but also alerts distant patrols. The flanking maneuver succeeds but takes longer than expected. Nothing is free. Success has cost. Show competent execution with realistic friction. No flawless victories.

5) Consolidate and reassess — after action, the squad secures the immediate area, checks casualties, reloads, and communicates status to command. This is not celebration; this is doctrine. Assess damage. Redistribute ammunition from casualties to active operators. Update mission status. The fight continues, but professionals take the moment to reset and prepare for the next phase.

## Dialogue

Military comms discipline dominates — transmissions are concise, clear, and structured. "Alpha Two, contact front, three hostiles, engaging." No filler. No ambiguity. Situation, location, action. Acknowledgments are minimal: "Copy," "Roger," "Wilco." Chatter is punished by command. Silence means operational security. Comm discipline is not personality suppression; it is survival. Teach the player to listen for subtext in brevity.

Standard callouts provide shared language — "Contact left!" "Reloading!" "Grenade out!" "Man down!" These are training-ingrained reflexes. Operators do not think about calling out; they do it because it is drilled. Let these callouts punctuate action without elaboration. The squad knows what they mean. Explain nothing. Trust the player to infer from context or learn through repetition.

Brevity increases under stress — when bullets fly, sentences disappear. Single words. "Move!" "Covering!" "Clear!" Fragmented communication is not failure; it is efficiency under duress. The squad does not need full sentences. They need information, fast. Let syntax collapse proportional to danger. When comms get clipped to one-word bursts, the player knows the situation is critical.

Post-action communication shifts to assessment — after contact, language expands slightly. "Two down, confirmed. No movement." "Ammunition status?" "Sixty percent, maybe less." "Vasquez took shrapnel, still mobile." Operators report status, check squad cohesion, and coordinate next steps. This is still professional, but the urgency drops. Show the shift from combat comms to tactical coordination. Tone changes with threat level.

Avoid heroic speeches and melodrama — squad leaders do not give inspirational monologues before missions. They give clear instructions. Soldiers do not bond through emotional declarations; they bond through shared experience and trust built on competence. If someone says something human and unguarded, it is during downtime, not in the field. Keep operational dialogue operational. Save the personal moments for when the mission is over.
