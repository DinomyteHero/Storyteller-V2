# Murder Mystery Style Guide

Premise: a puzzle wrapped in a death, where the detective must separate truth from lies and reveal which polite face conceals a killer.

## Tone

The puzzle is sacred — this mode is fundamentally about fair play. The player must be able to solve the mystery using information provided. Clues are planted visibly, even if their significance is not immediately apparent. Red herrings exist but are discoverable as such through logic and evidence. The detective (player) should feel clever when they solve it, not cheated. Design reveals to reward attention and deduction. The mystery is a game between author and player, and the rules are transparency and fairness.

Every character is a suspect until they are not — introduce the cast with attention to motive, means, and opportunity. Who benefited from the victim's death? Who had access to the murder weapon? Who cannot account for their whereabouts? Present each character as a viable suspect with something to hide (even if it is unrelated to the murder). Let the player build and discard theories. Suspicion should shift as evidence accumulates. The least obvious suspect should be exactly as possible as the most obvious.

Details matter, and the devil is in them — describe scenes with precision. The position of a body. The state of a room. What is present and what is absent. Inconsistencies in testimony. Timelines that do not quite align. These details are clues. Let the player notice them. Reward close reading and careful observation. The solution hinges on noticing what others overlook or what someone hoped would be overlooked.

Social dynamics conceal violence — murder happens in the context of relationships. Jealousy, greed, revenge, fear. The victim was hated, owed money, knew a secret, or stood in someone's way. Explore the social web around the victim. Who had reason to want them dead? What relationships were strained? What secrets might they have revealed? The crime is the climax of social forces that were building before the player arrived.

Order is restored through revelation — the detective's role is to impose clarity on chaos. The murder disrupted the community. The investigation heightens tension. The revelation of the killer restores (a version of) order. The detective names the guilty party, explains the method, and demonstrates motive. Justice is served, or at least truth is revealed. The ending provides catharsis through explanation. The world makes sense again, even if the sense is grim.

## Pacing

Open with the discovery of the body — establish the victim, the location, the immediate circumstances. Who found the body? When? Where? Describe the scene in detail: the position of the body, the state of the room, any obvious signs of struggle or method of death. Let the player see the crime scene with investigative eyes. This is the central puzzle piece. Everything else connects to this moment.

Establish the cast and their relationships to the victim — interview witnesses and suspects. Present each character's account of where they were and what they knew. Describe their reactions: shock, grief, fear, suspicion, or something else. Let each character reveal something about their relationship to the victim. Old grudges. Financial entanglements. Romantic connections. Build the social map. The player needs to understand who had reason to kill.

Investigate and gather evidence — search for physical evidence (weapon, documents, traces left at the scene) and testimonial evidence (who saw what, who said what, whose story conflicts with another's). Present evidence through description: the player finds a letter, examines a locked drawer, notices a stain on fabric, uncovers a receipt. Let investigation be active. The player chooses what to examine and who to question. Each piece of evidence is a puzzle piece that fits somewhere.

Complicate through contradiction and revelation — testimonies conflict. Physical evidence suggests a timeline that witnesses deny. Someone changes their story. A hidden relationship is revealed. The initial theory falls apart under scrutiny. Introduce complications that force the player to revise their understanding. Red herrings look like clues. Real clues look like irrelevant details. The player must separate signal from noise.

Climax with accusation and explanation — the detective confronts the killer, lays out the evidence, and explains how the crime was committed and why. The killer may confess, or deny and be proven guilty through demonstration of evidence. Walk through the logic: motive, means, opportunity. Address the key clues and how they implicate the guilty party. Let the explanation be satisfying. The player should see how the pieces fit together and recognize the clues they were given.

## Scene Beats

1) Establish the investigative question — what does the player need to know? Who had access to the victim during the relevant timeframe? What was the murder weapon? Why was the victim at this location? Frame the investigative task clearly. Each scene should answer one or more questions while potentially raising new ones. Forward progress is measured in knowledge gained.

2) Present the witness or evidence source — the player interviews a character or examines a location. Describe the person's demeanor: nervous, defensive, overly helpful, evasive. Or describe the space: orderly or disturbed, what is present or missing. Let the player observe before asking questions or examining evidence. First impressions matter. What seems off? What seems too perfect?

3) Extract information through questioning or examination — the player asks questions (directly or by selecting topics) or searches for physical evidence. Present responses or findings with specificity. Direct quotes from witnesses. Precise descriptions of objects found. Let information be concrete. Vague answers are themselves informative (what is the character avoiding?). Specific details are clues or potential clues.

4) Introduce complication or inconsistency — the witness's account contradicts someone else's. The physical evidence does not match the expected timeline. The motive that seemed obvious dissolves under scrutiny. Something does not fit. Mark the inconsistency clearly. Let the player notice that something is wrong. Inconsistencies are either errors in testimony (the witness is lying or mistaken) or errors in the detective's theory (the player has misunderstood something).

5) Close with updated theory or new lead — the player refines their understanding based on what they learned. They now suspect a different person, understand the method better, or recognize that they need to investigate something else. Mark progress. The mystery is narrowing, or expanding in a new direction. Each scene should shift the investigative landscape. The player should feel closer to the truth, even if the truth is not yet fully visible.

## Dialogue

Witnesses speak with purpose and concealment — no one tells the detective everything unprompted. Characters volunteer information that serves their interests (makes them look innocent, diverts suspicion to someone else, conceals something embarrassing). They omit what makes them look guilty. They lie about some things and tell the truth about others. Let dialogue be strategic. The player should learn to ask follow-up questions and notice evasions.

Interrogation tightens the screws — when the detective presses, characters get uncomfortable. They deflect, they justify, they attack the premise of the question. "I was not there" becomes "I may have been in the area" becomes "Yes, I was there, but I left before anything happened." Let pressure yield incremental revelations. Characters do not confess easily. They concede ground one piece at a time, and only when cornered.

Social class and relationships shape tone — a servant speaks deferentially. A noble speaks with assumed authority. A peer speaks more openly. Characters modulate their speech based on their relationship to the detective and their position in the social hierarchy. Let dialogue reflect social dynamics. A character who refuses deference is making a statement. A character who is overly polite may be hiding something behind courtesy.

Accusation provokes reaction — when the detective accuses someone, they respond with shock, anger, denial, or (rarely) confession. Innocent people are offended. Guilty people may bluster or counter-attack or suddenly become very cooperative in an attempt to redirect suspicion. Let accusation be a tool. The detective can test theories by accusing someone and observing their reaction. Does the denial ring true? Does the explanation hold up?

Avoid modern forensic jargon unless appropriate — if the setting supports advanced forensics, use precise language. If not, keep investigation language simple and observational. The detective notes details, draws inferences, and reasons from evidence without invoking technologies that do not exist in the setting. The method is observation, logic, and interrogation, not lab analysis (unless the setting includes that).
