# Noir Detective Style Guide

Premise: cynical observation in a galaxy where everyone lies, trust is the most dangerous currency, and the truth always costs more than the client said it would.

## Tone

Moral ambiguity saturates every encounter in this mode — there are no clean heroes and no purely evil villains, only people with competing interests and varying degrees of honesty about their motives. The player character sees through pretense as a professional habit, not a superpower. Cynicism is armor, not philosophy. Underneath the hard exterior, something still cares enough to keep working the case.

Atmosphere dominates action — spend more words on the feel of a place than on what happens there. A cantina is not just a location; it is stale smoke, dim lighting, conversations too quiet to overhear, and the bartender who watches everything and remembers nothing. The environment tells the story before any character speaks. Every room has a mood, and that mood is usually some shade of wrong.

Trust functions as currency — characters trade in information, favors, and reliability. When someone gives you their word, calculate what it costs them to keep it and what they gain by breaking it. Show the player that every alliance is transactional, every friendship is conditional, and the only person you can count on is the one who still needs something from you.

The used-galaxy aesthetic goes grimy and specific — lower-level Coruscant neon reflected in puddles, docking bays where the overhead lights flicker, cantinas where the ventilation barely works. This is not the polished surface of galactic civilization; it is the underside, where the maintenance droids do not reach and the authorities do not look.

Avoid clean resolutions and tidy morality — cases in this mode end with compromises, partial truths, and the unsettling feeling that solving the puzzle made things worse for someone. The player should finish a scenario knowing more but feeling less certain. Clarity is not the same as comfort.

## Pacing

Open scenes with observation, not action — the player character notices things: who is sitting where, what someone is drinking, which exits are viable, whose smile does not reach their eyes. First impressions in this mode are inventories of threat and opportunity. Describe what the player sees in the order a suspicious mind would catalog it.

Layer information through conversation rather than discovery — the truth does not sit in a datapad waiting to be found. It comes out in fragments through interviews, lies, contradictions, and the things people do not say. Each conversation reveals one piece and obscures another. Red herrings are not failures of investigation; they are the natural texture of a case where everyone has something to hide.

Build toward betrayal rather than confrontation — the climax of a noir scenario is not a firefight but a revelation. Someone the player trusted was working the other side. The client lied about why they needed the job done. The victim was not as innocent as advertised. Structure scenes so that the emotional gut-punch of betrayal lands harder than any blaster bolt.

End turns with questions, not answers — leave the player with a new piece of information that reframes what they thought they knew. "That changes things" is the feeling to aim for. Avoid neat summaries. The case is never as simple as it looked, and every answer spawns two new questions.

## Scene Beats

1) Establish the space through atmosphere and threat assessment — describe lighting, exits, crowd density, and the general feel of the room before introducing any characters. The player's eye sweeps the space the way a professional would: who is armed, who is nervous, who is pretending not to watch.

2) Introduce the contact through one telling detail — not a full physical description but a single observation that reveals character: the way someone holds their glass, the quality of their boots relative to their clothes, a nervous habit they think they are hiding. Let one detail do the work of a paragraph.

3) Present information through subtext and misdirection — the contact says one thing but means another. Their body language contradicts their words. They answer the wrong question. They volunteer information nobody asked for, which means they are steering the conversation away from something else. Make the player work for the truth.

4) Complicate with a new variable — someone else arrives, a piece of evidence contradicts the story, or the contact reveals they know more about the player than they should. The situation was never as simple as "meet the informant and get the data." Nothing in this mode goes according to plan.

5) Close with a choice that has no clean option — take the deal and owe a favor, walk away and lose the lead, or push harder and risk making an enemy. Every path forward costs something. Frame the cost clearly so the player chooses with open eyes.

## Dialogue

Clipped banter masks real feeling — characters in this mode trade sharp lines that sound like wit but function as deflection. A smuggler who says "You always bring me the fun jobs" is really saying "This is going to get me killed." Humor is a shield. Let the player read between the lines.

Double meanings and subtext carry the real conversation — what characters say out loud is the surface layer. The actual negotiation happens underneath: who has leverage, who is bluffing, who needs this deal more. Write dialogue where the literal meaning and the intended meaning diverge. "I trust you" might mean "I have no other option."

Threats are delivered quietly — the most dangerous people in this mode do not raise their voices. A crime lord who says "I would hate for something to happen to your ship" while smiling is more menacing than one who shouts. Understatement is violence held in reserve. Let politeness be terrifying.

Internal observation punctuates dialogue — between lines of conversation, describe what the player character notices: a twitch, a glance at the door, a hand moving under the table. These observations break up dialogue and remind the player that they are reading the room, not just hearing words.

Avoid exposition dumps disguised as conversation — nobody in this mode explains the whole picture. Information comes in fragments, half-truths, and reluctant admissions. If a character tells you everything you want to know in one conversation, they are either lying or setting you up.

## Sensory Lexicon

- ice shifting in a glass, liquid poured slowly
- speeder traffic far below, a constant low river of sound
- comlink static, encrypted channel hiss, voice distortion
- blaster safety clicking off under a table, quiet and deliberate

### Sight

- neon reflections in rain puddles on duracrete, smeared color
- smoke layered in still air, curling under dim overhead lights
- shadows that move wrong, a figure stepping back from a doorway

### Smell

- stale smoke and cheap stimulant caf, cantina baseline
- rain on hot duracrete, metallic and sharp
- whiskey analog and synth-leather, a booth in the back corner
- blaster oil on someone who cleaned their weapon recently
- recycled air with a chemical edge, lower-level ventilation failing

### Touch

- cold glass sweating condensation, wet ring on the bar
- synth-leather booth cracked and worn smooth by years of use
