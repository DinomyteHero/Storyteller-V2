# Court Intrigue Style Guide

Premise: ambition, betrayal, and succession games played in royal halls, where a smile can conceal a dagger and every alliance is temporary.

## Tone

Power is performed, not possessed — in the royal court, authority must be continuously demonstrated through ritual, display, and social dominance. A monarch who does not hold court loses influence. A noble who misses key ceremonies loses standing. Describe the theatricality of power: formal entrances, seating arrangements that encode hierarchy, the choreography of deference and dominance. Characters are always performing their status. The moment they stop performing, their position weakens.

Every relationship is transactional — friendships serve political ends. Marriages cement alliances. Lovers trade information. Even family loyalty has a price. Describe characters assessing what they can gain from each interaction. Conversations are negotiations. Gifts come with unspoken obligations. Favors create debts. Let every interaction have an exchange rate. The player should learn to read the calculation under the courtesy.

Reputation and perception are battlegrounds — what people believe about you matters more than what is true. A rumor of weakness invites challenge. An accusation of impropriety, even if false, damages alliances. Describe how information spreads: whispered gossip, strategic leaks, carefully placed innuendo. Characters fight to control narratives about themselves and damage narratives about rivals. The player must manage their public image as carefully as they manage physical resources.

Blood and legitimacy determine who can rule — succession is never simple. Eldest child, preferred child, legitimate vs illegitimate, direct line vs cadet branch. Claims compete. Factions form around rival claimants. Describe the legal and customary arguments each faction uses. Legitimacy is constructed through genealogy, precedent, and force. The player must understand the succession map to know whose rise or fall matters to their own position.

Violence is a tool deployed strategically, not emotionally — assassination, execution, and war happen in this mode, but they are calculated moves, not crimes of passion. Describe violence as political instrument. A rival is removed not from anger but because they blocked an alliance. A rebellion is crushed not from offense but to demonstrate strength. Show the cold logic. Emotional violence is the mark of an amateur. Professionals kill for strategic reasons and with plausible deniability.

## Pacing

Open with ceremony, court gathering, or formal occasion — a royal audience, a feast, a wedding, a funeral. Describe the setting with attention to hierarchy: who stands where, who is announced first, what colors and symbols people wear. Establish the social landscape. Who is present? Who is absent? Who sits near the monarch? Public gatherings are where alliances are signaled and slights are delivered. Begin with the theater of power.

Build through private conversations and strategic positioning — after the public scene, move to private meetings. The sidebar conversation in a corridor. The walk in the garden where no servants can overhear. The late-night meeting in someone's chambers. This is where real business occurs. Describe characters trading information, forming alliances, making offers, issuing warnings. Let each conversation shift the political landscape incrementally. Progress is made through accumulation of small moves.

Escalate through revelation or crisis — a scandal breaks. A claimant to the throne appears. A key figure dies or is arrested. A foreign power threatens war. The crisis disrupts the existing balance. Factions that were in uneasy equilibrium must now reposition. Alliances shift. The player must decide quickly where they stand and who they support. Show the scramble to adapt when the landscape suddenly changes.

Climax with confrontation or decisive move — an accusation delivered in open court. A vote or declaration that forces everyone to commit. A public betrayal that breaks an alliance. A coup or arrest. The moment where positions become locked and plausible deniability ends. Someone must take a stand. The player makes a choice that defines their position in the new order. Let the confrontation be public and consequential. Everyone will know where the player stood.

End with the new order and the player's position in it — the crisis resolves, at least temporarily. A new alliance structure emerges. The player has gained or lost standing. Describe their new position: whose favor they have, who now opposes them, what obligations they have incurred. The game continues. Today's victor may be tomorrow's target. The only certainty is that the struggle for power continues, and the player is deeper into it than before.

## Scene Beats

1) Establish the social geography with visual hierarchy — describe the room, the people, and the signals of status. The monarch on a raised dais. The inner circle standing closest. The outer circle at the periphery. The absence of certain figures. Clothing, jewelry, retinue size — all encode power. Let the player read the room. Who matters? Who is rising? Who is in disfavor? Social space is a map of political power.

2) Introduce the political question or pressure — a succession dispute, a resource allocation, a marriage negotiation, a foreign policy decision. Frame the issue clearly. Who wants what? What are the competing interests? What is at stake for each faction? Let the player understand the chessboard. Political problems are puzzles with human pieces. Show the pieces and their interests.

3) Present a choice of allegiance or action — the player must position themselves. Support one claimant over another. Align with one faction. Offer support in exchange for future favor. Deliver information to a patron. Frame the choice with clear tradeoffs. Aligning with the strong is safer but gains less reward. Backing a weaker claimant is risky but could yield greater return. Let the player weigh risk and reward.

4) Complicate with betrayal, revelation, or counter-move — someone the player trusted acts against them. Information the player relied on was false. A faction the player opposed makes an unexpected alliance. The landscape shifts. The player's previous move may now look foolish or prescient depending on how they adapt. Show that everyone else is also playing. The player is not the only actor. Others have agency and agendas.

5) Close with consequence and reputation shift — the player's action has effects. They gained an ally but made an enemy. They learned something valuable but exposed their interest. They secured a favor but now owe one. Their reputation shifted: are they seen as loyal, ambitious, shrewd, or reckless? Let the consequence be social and political. The material outcome matters less than what people now believe about the player.

## Dialogue

Speech is formal, indirect, and heavy with implication — court language is not plain. "It would be unfortunate if the northern lords felt overlooked" means "If you do not give them something, they will rebel." "I value our family's long friendship" means "Remember you owe us." Characters speak in euphemism, metaphor, and coded language. Train the player to listen for the meaning under the words. What is being said vs what is being communicated.

Titles and forms of address are weapons and tools — addressing someone correctly demonstrates respect or knowledge of protocol. Using a lesser title is an insult. Using a familiar form of address presumes intimacy or claims it. Describe how characters calibrate their speech. "Your Grace" is different from "My Lord" is different from first name usage. Each choice signals a relational claim. Let shifts in address mark shifts in power or intimacy.

Compliments carry hidden edges — praise is often comparison. "Your son is remarkably brave, unlike most young men at court" is an insult to other young men and potentially to the son (implying recklessness). Characters use compliments to position themselves and others. Teach the player to distrust flattery and look for the angle. Why is this person saying this, to me, now, in front of these witnesses?

Questions are more dangerous than statements — a question forces the target to commit to a position. "Do you support the king's decision?" is a trap. Agreement or disagreement will be noted and used. Skilled court operators deflect questions with questions or vague non-answers. "I serve the realm" commits to nothing while sounding loyal. Let characters fence with questions. The player should learn when to answer and when to evade.

Silence is a strategic move — a character who does not speak when expected to speak is making a statement. The king asks a question and receives no answer. The insult is delivered and no one defends the target. Silence can be support, condemnation, or calculated neutrality. Mark when characters do not speak. Their silence communicates as much as words.
