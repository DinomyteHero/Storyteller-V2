# Gothic Romance Style Guide

Premise: passion and danger intertwined in decaying grandeur, where love is as likely to destroy as save, and the past refuses to stay buried.

## Tone

Atmosphere is character — the setting is not backdrop but active presence. Describe ancient estates with crumbling facades, rain-lashed towers, candlelit halls where shadows pool in corners. Weather mirrors emotional states: storms during confrontations, fog obscuring truth, oppressive heat before revelation. Every location should feel heavy with history and secrets. Architecture itself has intent. Doors that should not be locked are locked. Rooms that should be empty show signs of habitation. Let the environment be as important as any character.

Desire and dread are inseparable — attraction is never simple or safe in this mode. The person the player is drawn to has dangerous secrets. The relationship that promises salvation might be the player's doom. Love coexists with fear. When characters kiss, it should feel like surrender as much as triumph. Romantic tension should carry weight, consequence, and the possibility of genuine harm. Passion is not light or playful here; it is consuming and potentially ruinous.

Secrets structure every relationship — no one is entirely honest. Family histories are concealed. True names are withheld. Pasts are selectively edited. Every character has something they cannot or will not reveal, and that hidden knowledge shapes their behavior. Trust is earned through revelation, but revelation carries risk. What you learn about someone may make you love them more, or it may horrify you. The player should feel the tension between wanting to know and fearing what they will learn.

The past contaminates the present — old grievances, ancient betrayals, and unresolved tragedies shape current events. A murder decades ago echoes in present danger. A forbidden love from a previous generation repeats in the player's story. Describe how history persists: portraits of the dead watching from walls, libraries filled with letters and journals, bloodstains that were never fully scrubbed away. Nothing is ever truly over. The dead do not rest, and their actions haunt the living.

Beauty and decay coexist — this mode aestheticizes ruin. Describe faded elegance: velvet curtains rotting at the hems, gilt frames tarnished, marble cracked but still grand. Emphasize textures of decline. Flowers blooming in overgrown gardens. Exquisite gowns with moths in the fabric. The beautiful thing that is falling apart is more compelling than pristine perfection. Decay is romantic. Let entropy be gorgeous.

## Pacing

Open with atmospheric arrival or inheritance — the player comes to the estate, the isolated manor, the ancestral holding. Describe the approach: long drive through untended grounds, the building looming against storm-darkened sky, the sense of crossing a threshold into a space governed by different rules. Establish isolation immediately. This place is cut off. Communication is difficult. Help is distant. The player is entering a world apart.

Build through incremental revelation and mounting unease — the player learns pieces of the secret through discovered letters, overheard conversations, forbidden rooms finally accessed, and confessions extracted under emotional duress. Each revelation raises more questions than it answers. Layer the mystery. What happened to the previous occupant? Why does no one speak of the east wing? Who is the figure seen at midnight in the garden? Let knowledge accumulate slowly, each piece troubling.

Intensify through emotional confrontation and physical danger — Gothic romance is not all yearning glances. Violence erupts: someone is pushed, struck, or threatened. The love interest reveals a capacity for cruelty or madness. The player is trapped, pursued, or betrayed. Danger is personal and intimate, not abstract. The person who threatened you at knifepoint is the same person you kissed last night. Let emotional entanglement complicate survival instincts.

Climax with revelation that recontextualizes everything — the secret is finally exposed. The player learns the truth of their own lineage, the love interest's true nature, the house's history. This revelation should be both horrifying and illuminating. It explains the strange behavior, the locked rooms, the warnings. But understanding does not guarantee safety. Often, knowing makes things worse. The truth is a threshold. Crossing it changes everything.

End with ambiguous resolution — Gothic romance does not provide clean happy endings. The relationship is forever changed. The player may leave, but they carry the place with them. Or they stay, accepting what the relationship is, darkness and all. Or the ending is more tragic: the love interest is lost, the estate burns, the curse claims another victim. Whatever the resolution, it should feel inevitable, earned, and tinged with melancholy. Satisfaction coexists with loss.

## Scene Beats

1) Establish the space with sensory decay — describe the physical environment in intimate, tactile detail. The temperature: cold stone, insufficient fireplaces, drafts from ill-fitted windows. The smell: mildew, old wood, candle wax, dust. The sound: the house settling, wind through cracks, distant footsteps. Ground the player in a space that feels real, lived-in, and declining. Atmosphere first.

2) Introduce the emotional charge — attraction, suspicion, fear, or fascination between the player and another character. Describe body language: a look held too long, a hand withdrawn before touch, proximity that is either charged or threatening. Emotional stakes are immediate. The person across the room knows something, wants something, or fears something. Let tension be palpable.

3) Present a threshold the player must cross — a door that has been locked, a question that has been avoided, a room no one enters, a topic no one discusses. The player can choose to press forward into forbidden space (physical or conversational) or retreat to safety. Crossing the threshold promises revelation but risks consequence. Frame the choice clearly. Let the player feel the decision's weight.

4) Complicate with conflicting loyalties or information — another character provides contradictory information, or the player discovers evidence that challenges what they believed. The love interest who seemed protective may be possessive and controlling. The family member who warned them away may have their own agenda. Introduce doubt. The player should question their judgments and alliances.

5) Close with a revelation and a new question — the player learns something significant: a name, a date, a relationship, a crime. This knowledge shifts the landscape. They now understand one aspect of the mystery. But the revelation opens new uncertainty. If this was true, what else is true? If this person lied, who else is lying? Progress the mystery while maintaining momentum. Always leave the player with a new question.

## Dialogue

Speech is formal and layered with subtext — characters do not speak plainly. They hint, evade, and imply. "You should not be here after dark" is both warning and threat. "My brother has always been... intense in his affections" is confession wrapped in euphemism. Let characters communicate more through what they do not say than what they do. Silences between words carry meaning. Hesitations are tells.

Terms of address encode relationships — how characters address each other shifts with intimacy and power dynamics. Last names and titles maintain distance. Use of first names signals intimacy or presumption. The shift from "Lady Vayren" to "Celeste" is a narrative event. Track these shifts. Let them mark relational change. When a character insists on formality after previous intimacy, that is a statement.

Questions are deflected, not answered — direct questions receive indirect responses. "Where were you last night?" is met with "I might ask you the same." Characters protect their secrets by redirecting inquiry. They answer questions with questions. They provide partial truths that obscure as much as they reveal. Let the player feel the frustration of trying to extract honesty from people who have practiced evasion for years.

Passion breaks through formality — moments of genuine emotion crack the controlled speech. A declaration of love or rage that interrupts the careful verbal dance. "I cannot bear this pretense any longer" — the mask drops, briefly. These moments are powerful because they contrast with the usual restraint. Use them sparingly. When a character loses control of their language, the player should pay attention.

Avoid modern colloquialisms entirely — language should feel elevated and slightly archaic. No contractions unless deliberately showing class difference or intimacy. No casual slang. Speech patterns should mirror literature of manners and Gothic fiction. Dialogue is a formal performance most of the time, which makes the moments of raw honesty hit harder.
