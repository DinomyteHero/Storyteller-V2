# Heist Caper Style Guide

Premise: elaborate schemes executed by specialists playing their roles, where the real victory is not what you steal but how brilliantly you steal it.

## Tone

Style matters as much as success — the crew does not just complete the job; they do it with flair. The plan has elegant symmetry. The con has layers within layers. The escape is timed to the second. Emphasize craft and artistry in execution. These are professionals who take pride in their work. A sloppy success is failure to them. The player should feel satisfaction not just from obtaining the objective but from how cleanly they obtained it. Make competence sexy.

Every specialist has their moment — the crew is assembled because each member brings irreplaceable skills. The face talks their way past security. The tech defeats the security grid. The muscle handles physical obstacles. The wheelman gets everyone out. Structure scenes to showcase each specialist's expertise. Let them solve problems in their domain with practiced mastery. The satisfaction comes from watching experts work. Give each role time in the spotlight.

The plan has layers the audience does not see yet — misdirection is not just for the target; it is for the player too. Setbacks that turn out to be intentional. Failures that were part of the plan. A crew member getting captured who was supposed to get captured. Reveal that earlier scenes were positioning pieces for this payoff. Trust the structure. Let the player feel clever when they realize how pieces fit together. The best heists make you recontextual earlier events.

Tension comes from watching the plan execute, not from chaos — this is not improvisation; this is choreography. The thrill is seeing whether the crew can hit their marks under pressure. A timer counts down. Security patterns must be threaded with split-second timing. One delay cascades into other complications. Build tension through precision under constraint, not random disasters. Let the player sweat the details. Close calls where the crew barely maintains schedule are more satisfying than last-minute improvisation.

There is always another angle — when the plan seems to fail, that is when you reveal there was a deeper plan. The vault was always the distraction; the real score was in the loading bay. The betrayal was anticipated and countered. The crew that got arrested had extraction planned from the start. Layer contingencies. Make the player question what they are really watching. The moment they think they understand the full picture, peel back another layer.

## Pacing

Open with the crew assembling or the target being revealed — introduce the team through their reputations and specialties. "You need someone who can slice corporate-grade ICE? I know a person." Show the target: the secure facility, the valuable object, the impossible challenge. Let the scale of difficulty be clear. This is not a smash-and-grab. This requires planning, coordination, and expertise. Establish stakes: what they stand to gain, what they risk if caught.

The planning phase breaks down the problem — the crew studies the target, identifies obstacles, and crafts the plan. Security rotations. Guard shift changes. Biometric locks. Laser grids. Each obstacle gets a solution assigned to a specialist. Describe this with visual clarity, like they are marking up a schematic. "Chen handles the guard changeover. Rix spoofs the biometric scanner. I keep the client distracted." Let the player see the blueprint. A good plan is its own satisfaction.

Execution begins smooth and escalates through complications — the crew moves with practiced coordination. Early beats go exactly as planned: the diversion works, the entry is clean, the first security layer is defeated. Establish competence. Then introduce friction: a guard returns early, a system has an unexpected update, a crew member's tool malfunctions. Complications are not catastrophic; they are problems to solve in real-time. Show the crew adapting, using backup plans, and leaning on each other's skills.

The plan seems to unravel, then reveals a deeper layer — something goes wrong that appears to jeopardize the whole operation. The crew gets caught, or the target is moved, or a betrayal surfaces. This is the moment of maximum tension. Then pull back the curtain: this was accounted for. Show how earlier scenes were positioning for this exact scenario. The "failure" was bait. The real plan continues. Let the player feel the relief and cleverness of the reveal.

End with the score and the twist — the crew succeeds, but the turn should deliver one more surprise. The person who hired them was playing a different game. The thing they stole is not what they thought it was. A crew member who seemed uninvolved was the mastermind. Or: the success is clean, the crew gets away, and the satisfaction is watching them walk away from an impossible job executed perfectly. Either way, end with payoff. The genre demands a finale that reframes what came before.

## Scene Beats

1) Establish the obstacle with technical precision — describe the security system, the guard patrol pattern, the vault mechanism, the sensor grid. Use specific details: "Biometric lock with retinal scan and palm vein reader. Refreshes every thirty seconds, so spoofing requires continuous transmission." Make the problem concrete and solvable. Vagueness creates frustration. Specificity allows the player to appreciate the solution.

2) Assign the specialist and their approach — identify which crew member handles this obstacle and preview their method. "Rix is a ghost in the network. She will insert a loop into the surveillance feed, giving us a sixty-second window." Set expectations. The specialist knows what they are doing. Their confidence is contagious. This is their area of expertise, and the crew trusts them.

3) Execute with style and precision — describe the specialist working with practiced ease. Fingers dancing across a datapad. Smooth talk disarming suspicion. A perfectly timed distraction. Show competence in action. Let the solution be clever, not just functional. The player should appreciate the craft. This is not just solving the problem; this is solving it beautifully.

4) Introduce a complication that tests adaptation — something unexpected happens. A system behaves differently than the intelligence suggested. A crew member's timing is off by seconds. A bystander gets involved. The complication is not catastrophic but requires adjustment. Show the crew pivoting. Backup plans. Improvisation within structure. The complication proves their competence rather than undermining it.

5) Resolve and advance to the next phase — the obstacle is defeated. The crew moves deeper into the facility, closer to the target, further into the plan. Mark progress clearly. "Vault access in three minutes. Stay on schedule." Let the player feel momentum. Each phase completed is a small victory building toward the big payoff. Keep the tempo moving forward.

## Dialogue

The crew speaks in shorthand built from past jobs — references to previous operations that are never fully explained. "Remember Prague?" "This is nothing like Prague." "Prague had an exit strategy." The crew shares history. Let their dialogue reference unseen adventures that establish competence and camaraderie. The player does not need to know what Prague was. The crew's familiarity with each other is the point.

Technical jargon is used precisely and confidently — crew members speak in the language of their specialties. "I am bypassing the ICE with a cyclic redundancy loop. Give me ninety seconds." They do not over-explain. Jargon establishes expertise. If the player does not understand every word, that is fine. The crew understands, and their confidence sells it. Trust the audience to infer from context.

Banter reveals personality under pressure — humor is how the crew manages stress. Sarcasm, understatement, and playful ribbing. "You said this would be easy." "I said it would be impossible. That is easy for us." Banter is not constant; it appears when tension allows. Under peak stress, communication gets clipped. When the crew has breathing room, personality returns. Let dialogue rhythm reflect operational tempo.

The face talks in layered persuasion — when conning a target, dialogue is performance. The face uses misdirection, flattery, strategic truth, and charm to guide the target where they need them. Every word is calculated. Show the target being skillfully managed without the face ever seeming manipulative. The best cons make the mark think it was their idea. Let the player see the craft in social engineering.

Avoid explaining the plan during execution — the crew does not narrate what they are doing or why. They just do it. Explanation happens in planning phase or afterward. During the heist, dialogue is operational: status updates, problem calls, timing confirmations. "We are on the third floor. Two minutes to vault access. Chen, status?" Let action speak. Over-explanation kills momentum and undermines competence.
