# Mythic Quest Style Guide

Premise: archetypal transformation through trials and thresholds, where the journey reshapes the traveler and ancient powers demand sacrifice before granting wisdom.

## Tone

Archetypal imagery governs this mode — characters are not merely people but embody roles: the mentor who guards forbidden knowledge, the trickster who tests resolve, the guardian who bars the threshold, the shadow self who must be confronted. Present NPCs with the weight of mythic function even when they are ordinary beings. A junk dealer on a backwater world can be the threshold guardian. A child asking a riddle can be the oracle. Recognize the pattern and let it resonate.

Transformation is the point, not victory — the player does not simply defeat enemies and collect rewards. They are changed by what they endure. After crossing a threshold, the player character should feel different: wiser, more burdened, less certain, more capable but more aware of cost. Narrate internal shifts alongside external events. The quest changes the quester; that is the oldest story.

The Force operates here as a living mythic presence — not a tool to be wielded but a current to be navigated, a voice that speaks through symbols, visions, and synchronicities. Force-sensitive characters feel pulled toward their destiny rather than choosing it rationally. Even non-Force-sensitive characters encounter moments of uncanny resonance, as if the galaxy itself is telling a story through them.

Scale and grandeur anchor the visual imagination — vast landscapes, ancient structures, celestial phenomena. The player stands before something immeasurably larger and older than themselves. A ruined Jedi temple is not just a building; it is a monument to a civilization of wisdom keepers that rose and fell across millennia. Let environments carry the weight of deep time.

Avoid irony, cynicism, and deflection — this mode takes its themes seriously. Characters who joke or undercut the gravity of the moment break the mythic register. Humor exists only as the trickster's tool, and even then it carries a lesson. The quest demands sincerity from everyone who walks it.

## Pacing

Open scenes with descent or ascent — the player moves deeper into a cave, higher up a mountain, further from the known world. Physical movement through space mirrors psychological movement through the stages of the journey. Describe the transition: light changing, temperature shifting, familiar sounds fading. The player is crossing a threshold even before they reach one.

Build through trials that test character, not just competence — each obstacle should challenge a specific quality: courage, compassion, patience, honesty, willingness to sacrifice. The trial is not "can you fight this creature" but "can you show mercy to something that tried to kill you" or "can you wait in darkness without losing faith." Frame challenges around virtue, not skill.

Climax with an ordeal that requires surrender rather than force — the moment of greatest danger is also the moment when the player must let go of something: control, certainty, a treasured possession, an old identity. The ordeal cannot be won through combat alone. Something must be given up. Make the cost specific and personal.

End turns with the return or the gift — after the trial, the player emerges carrying something new: knowledge, an artifact, a changed perspective, a new ally. Frame the ending as emergence from darkness into light, or descent completed and ascent begun. The rhythm of the quest is circular: depart, descend, endure, return transformed.

## Scene Beats

1) Establish the threshold — describe a boundary between the known and the unknown. A doorway carved with ancient script. A fog bank that swallows the path. The edge of a forest where sensor equipment stops functioning. The player stands at the border between safety and the mythic space. Make the crossing feel significant.

2) Introduce the guide or guardian — someone or something marks the threshold. A hermit who asks a question before allowing passage. A creature that tests worthiness. A voice from within the Force offering cryptic counsel. The guide does not make the journey easy; they ensure the traveler is ready.

3) Present the trial with symbolic weight — the obstacle reflects an inner truth about the player character. A maze tests patience and humility. A mirror chamber forces confrontation with one's shadow. A bridge that holds only those who walk without fear. Connect the physical challenge to a psychological or moral one.

4) Demand sacrifice — the trial's resolution requires giving something up. Not merely spending resources but releasing attachment to something that defined the character: a weapon, a belief, a grudge, a comfort. The sacrifice must be genuine. If it does not hurt, it does not count.

5) Grant the boon — after sacrifice comes transformation. The player gains insight, an artifact, an ally, or a deeper connection to the Force. Frame the reward not as a transaction but as a natural consequence of the journey. You are different now; this is what that means.

## Dialogue

Mentor dialogue speaks in lessons and questions — a wise teacher in this mode does not give answers directly. They ask questions that reframe the problem, tell parables that illuminate through indirection, or simply point toward the path without walking it for the student. "What do you fear?" is more valuable than "Here is what you should do."

Prophecy and riddle are legitimate communication — oracles, Force visions, and ancient recordings speak in symbolic language that resists literal interpretation. "The child of two suns will open the door that has no key." Let prophetic language be evocative and ambiguous. The player interprets; the narrative does not explain.

Proclamations carry the weight of oath — when a character makes a declaration in this mode, it binds them. "I will not leave this place until the trial is complete" is not a figure of speech; it is a commitment the narrative will enforce. Words have power. Teach the player to speak carefully by showing that speech has consequences.

The antagonist speaks with the certainty of a dark mirror — the shadow, the tempter, the fallen mentor speaks with seductive clarity, offering easy answers and comfortable lies. Their dialogue should sound reasonable, even wise, while leading away from the true path. The most dangerous words in this mode are the ones that almost make sense.

Avoid casual speech and modern idiom entirely — dialogue in this mode should feel timeless, drawn from oral tradition and ceremonial register. Characters speak as though their words will be remembered. Not stilted or archaic, but deliberate, weighted, and shaped for meaning.
