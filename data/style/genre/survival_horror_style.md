# Survival Horror Style Guide

Premise: isolated, under-equipped, hunted in the dark, where the greatest threat is what you cannot see and no place stays safe for long.

## Tone

Resource scarcity defines every decision in this mode — the player never has enough power cells, medpacs, oxygen, or ammunition. Every blaster shot spent is one fewer for the next encounter. Every medpac used now is one unavailable later. Track and mention consumables regularly. The player should feel the weight of diminishing supplies in every choice they make. Abundance is suspicious; if you find a cache, ask what killed the people who stocked it.

Creeping dread outweighs shock — sustained unease is more effective than jump scares. The corridor is too quiet. The motion tracker shows nothing, but the air feels wrong. Something scraped against the hull two decks below an hour ago, and it has not happened again. Build anxiety through absence and anticipation rather than constant threat. The imagination fills silence with worse things than any description can provide.

Isolation amplifies everything — the player is cut off from reinforcements, communication is unreliable, and the people nearby may be compromised, injured, or panicking. Show how isolation erodes judgment and trust. When the comms are down and the nearest help is parsecs away, every shadow becomes a threat and every crewmate becomes a question mark.

Body horror connects the alien to the personal — the threat does not just kill; it changes, corrupts, inhabits, or consumes. Describe biological wrongness: skin that moves independently, joints bending in new directions, familiar faces wearing unfamiliar expressions. The body — yours, your allies' — is not guaranteed to remain yours. This violation of the physical self is more disturbing than any amount of violence.

No safe spaces exist — locations that were secure become compromised. Locked doors are breached. Vents connect every room. The creature learns, adapts, or was already inside when you sealed the bulkhead. Deny the player the comfort of a defensible position. Rest is temporary. Safety is an illusion that the narrative should periodically shatter.

## Pacing

Open scenes with false calm and environmental wrongness — the lights work, the corridor is clear, but something is slightly off. A wall panel removed and not replaced. A smear on the deck plates that was not there before. A door cycling open and closed at irregular intervals. Establish normalcy and then introduce one detail that breaks it. Let the player notice before you tell them what it means.

Build tension through incomplete information — the player hears something but cannot identify it. The scanner shows movement but loses the signal. They find evidence of what happened but not what caused it. Provide fragments that suggest a larger, worse picture without confirming it. Uncertainty is the engine of horror. The moment the threat is fully understood, it becomes a problem to solve rather than something to fear.

Punctuate slow build with sudden, brief terror — after sustained tension, deliver one moment of visceral shock: a face in the viewport that should not be there, a hand grabbing an ankle from under a grate, a sound that resolves into screaming. Keep these moments short and sharp. Then return to quiet, which now feels different. The player knows the threat is real, and the silence is no longer empty.

End turns with compromised safety — the sealed room has a vent they did not notice. The ally they rescued is running a fever. The power cells they found are nearly depleted. The escape route passes through the section where they lost contact with the scouting team. Every ending should narrow options and increase vulnerability. The player moves forward because staying is worse.

## Scene Beats

1) Establish the space through damage and absence — describe what is broken, missing, or wrong. Emergency lighting casting red shadows. A corridor where half the overhead panels are dark. A workstation still running with no one at the console. The environment should feel recently abandoned or actively deteriorating. Show the aftermath of something the player was not present for.

2) Introduce sensory threat before visual confirmation — the player hears, smells, or feels the presence before they see it. A sound like wet fabric dragging across durasteel. A smell that is organic and wrong in a sterile environment. A temperature drop that has no mechanical explanation. Let the non-visual senses do the work of building dread.

3) Force a resource decision — the player must choose between using a limited resource now or saving it. Spend the last power cell to seal a blast door, or save it for the weapon. Use the medpac on the injured ally who might slow them down, or keep it for themselves. Frame these choices without judgment. Survival demands hard math.

4) Reveal one piece of the larger horror — through a datalog, a corpse, a security recording, or a survivor's fragmented account, the player learns something about the threat that makes it worse. It is not just one creature; there were eggs. The infection has an incubation period. The distress signal was sent three weeks ago and no one came. Each revelation should tighten the noose.

5) Shatter the current safe position — whatever temporary security the player established, compromise it. The barricade fails, the ally turns, the power goes out, the creature finds another way in. End the scene with the player in motion, forced to move to the next position of uncertain safety.

## Dialogue

Dialogue is whispered, fragmented, and urgent — characters speak in short bursts, interrupt themselves, and trail off when they hear something. Full sentences are a luxury. "Did you--" "Quiet." "The door, is it--" "I don't know." Fragmented speech communicates fear more effectively than complete thoughts. Let syntax break down under pressure.

Technical language becomes lifeline — characters cling to procedural communication as a way to maintain control. "Seal bulkhead seven, reroute power to section three, check the oxygen scrubbers." Procedure is sanity. When a character stops speaking in procedure and starts speaking in emotion, the situation has exceeded their ability to cope.

Survivor accounts are unreliable and contradictory — anyone the player finds alive is traumatized, possibly in shock, and may be lying about what they saw or what they did. "It came through the wall" might be literal or might be panic. "Everyone else is dead" might mean "I left them." Do not clarify. Let the player decide who to trust and what to believe.

Silence from an ally is alarming — when a crewmate who has been talking stops responding, that silence is a narrative event. Note it. "Ren has not spoken for several minutes" carries more dread than any description of a monster. Silence means something has changed, and the player does not yet know what.

Avoid bravado and one-liners entirely — no character in this mode is having a good time. Humor is either absent or the brittle, inappropriate laughter of someone on the edge of breaking. If a character cracks a joke, it lands wrong, and everyone knows it. This is not an action movie. This is survival.

## Sensory Lexicon

### Sound
- dripping in the dark, irregular and echoing, source unidentifiable
- ventilation cycling on and off, each silence a held breath
- something scraping against the hull, slow and deliberate
- distant impact, metal on metal, too rhythmic to be mechanical failure
- the player's own breathing amplified inside a sealed helmet
- a sound like a voice but not a voice, coming from the wrong direction

### Sight
- emergency lighting casting everything in red shadow, depth perception gone
- darkness beyond the reach of a glow rod, absolute and textured
- condensation on cold durasteel, beading and dripping in patterns
- a handprint in something dark smeared along a corridor wall
- movement at the edge of vision that is gone when you turn
- a closed door with something pressing against it from the other side

### Smell
- recycled air gone stale, carbon dioxide building
- organic decay where nothing organic should be, sweet and wrong
- ozone from shorted electrical systems, sharp and immediate
- blood and copper tang in a space that was sterile an hour ago
- chemical coolant leaking, acrid burn in the nostrils

### Touch
- cold sweat inside gloves, grip slipping on a weapon stock
- vibration through the deck plates, rhythmic, not matching any engine cycle
- humidity in a corridor that should be climate-controlled, warm and wet
- the click of a power cell seating into a blaster, the last one
- something sticky underfoot that was not there on the way in
- a door handle that is warm when it should be cold
