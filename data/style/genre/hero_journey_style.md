# Hero's Journey Style Guide

Premise: the monomyth as structural engine, where every Star Wars story follows the arc of departure, initiation, and return — the player is the hero, and the galaxy is the labyrinth they must navigate to be transformed.

## Tone

Every scene exists on the Hero's Journey — whether the player knows it or not. The Ordinary World is not boring; it is the foundation that makes departure meaningful. A cantina on a backwater world is not just a location; it is the last familiar place before the unknown. Frame every setting with awareness of where the player stands on the mythic arc.

Transformation is earned through suffering and choice — the hero does not level up; they are broken down and rebuilt. After each major trial, narrate the internal shift. The player who crossed the threshold is not the same person who returns. Show this in small details: the way they hold their weapon differently, the new wariness in their eyes, the silence where there used to be bravado.

The Force amplifies the mythic register — it is not technology or magic but the connective tissue of the monomyth itself. Force visions echo the hero's inner journey. Disturbances in the Force mirror disturbances in the soul. Even non-Force-sensitive characters feel the pull of destiny as coincidence, intuition, and dread.

Archetypes inhabit every character — the mentor is not just wise but specifically wise in the way the hero needs. The shadow is not just evil but specifically the darkness the hero refuses to acknowledge in themselves. The threshold guardian tests exactly the quality the hero most needs to develop. Let NPCs fulfill their mythic function naturally.

## Pacing

### Ordinary World / Setup
Linger in the familiar. Let the player feel the weight of their daily existence: the routines, the relationships, the small frustrations and comforts. The ordinary world must feel real so its loss means something. Describe through specific, grounded detail — not "a peaceful village" but "the smell of engine grease and the sound of a child laughing somewhere behind the repair shop."

### Call to Adventure
The disruption should feel both external and internal. Something happens in the world — a message, a stranger, a disaster — but it resonates with something the character already felt: restlessness, guilt, longing, unfinished business. The call speaks to what the hero already wanted but was afraid to pursue.

### Crossing the Threshold
This is the point of no return. Narrate it with physical and emotional specificity. The character steps through a door, boards a ship, makes a promise they cannot take back. Behind them, the familiar world recedes. Ahead, everything is unknown. The threshold crossing should feel both terrifying and exhilarating.

### Tests, Allies, Enemies
The new world has different rules. Each encounter teaches the hero something they could not have learned at home. Allies appear in unexpected forms. Enemies are not always obvious. The hero makes mistakes and pays for them. Pacing here should alternate between action and reflection.

### The Ordeal
Slow everything down. The supreme crisis deserves weight and space. Let the tension build before the confrontation. Describe the approach: the narrowing corridor, the thickening darkness, the growing sense that this is where everything changes. The ordeal is not just a fight; it is a reckoning.

### The Return
Acceleration. The hero has what they came for — now they must bring it back. New obstacles arise from the consequences of the ordeal. The return journey is not the same path walked backward; it is a new challenge requiring everything the hero has learned.

## Scene Beats

1) Mirror the external with the internal — every landscape reflects the hero's psychological state. A character in turmoil walks through a storm. A character at peace finds a clearing. A character facing their shadow descends underground. Let geography be psychology.

2) Mark thresholds explicitly — when the player crosses from one stage of the journey to the next, signal it through the environment. A change in light, temperature, sound. A doorway, a bridge, a canyon edge. The transition should feel physical.

3) Let silence carry weight — in the mythic register, silence is not absence but presence. The moment before the ordeal. The moment after sacrifice. The moment of recognition when the hero sees what they have become. Do not fill these moments with action; let them breathe.

4) End with forward motion — every scene should end with the hero moving toward the next threshold. Not a cliffhanger necessarily, but a sense of inevitable momentum. The journey continues. The path leads deeper.

## Dialogue

Mentor figures speak in questions and stories — they do not lecture. They ask the question the hero is afraid to ask themselves. They tell a story that only makes sense later. Their wisdom is oblique, forcing the hero to interpret.

Shadow figures speak the hero's own doubts back to them — the most effective villain dialogue in the mythic register is not threat but temptation. "You know I am right" is more dangerous than "I will destroy you." The shadow voice should sound disturbingly reasonable.

The hero's own dialogue evolves across the journey — in the Ordinary World, casual and uncertain. After the threshold, more deliberate. During the ordeal, raw and honest. After the return, quiet and weighted with experience. Let the player hear their character growing through the words they choose to say.

## Sensory Lexicon

### Sound
- the hum of hyperspace engines, constant and almost meditative
- a distant alarm that might be warning or invitation
- footsteps echoing in a vast empty space, each step a commitment
- the ignition of a lightsaber — not just sound but a declaration
- wind carrying voices that might be memory or the Force or both

### Sight
- the binary sunset that means both ending and beginning
- a path that forks, each direction vanishing into different darkness
- the reflection of the hero in a dark surface, looking back changed
- distant lights of a city the hero cannot yet reach
- an ancient symbol carved into stone, half-eroded but still legible

### Smell
- smoke from something that was recently on fire, aftermath
- the clean cold air of altitude, thin and sharp and honest
- deep underground mineral darkness, the smell of the earth itself
- ozone and burning — the aftermath of Force lightning or blaster fire
- rain on dust, the scent of transformation

### Touch
- the weight of a weapon that now feels like responsibility
- cold metal of a ship's hull, the boundary between atmosphere and void
- the roughness of ancient stone under fingers searching for a handhold
- heat radiating from a power core or a lightsaber crystal
- the handshake or embrace that seals an alliance
