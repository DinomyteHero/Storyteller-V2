# Post-Apocalyptic Style Guide

Premise: civilization has collapsed, and survivors navigate the ruins, scavenging resources and building fragile communities while fending off those who would take everything they have.

## Tone

Scarcity defines every choice — clean water, ammunition, medicine, fuel, food. Nothing is abundant. Everything valuable is guarded, rationed, or fought over. Describe resource states constantly. How much ammunition remains. How many days of food. Whether the water source is contaminated. Let the player feel the weight of every expended resource. Firing a weapon is not just tactical; it is burning irreplaceable ammunition. Using medicine now means not having it later. Scarcity is the texture of every scene.

The past is both resource and warning — survivors scavenge the ruins of the old world for supplies: canned food past its date, fuel in underground tanks, tools in abandoned workshops, medicine in ransacked pharmacies. But the ruins also contain dangers: unstable structures, radiation zones, toxic waste, automated defenses still functioning. Describe the ruins with ambivalence. They provide what the player needs to survive, but they also remind the player of what was lost and how thoroughly it was lost.

Trust is the rarest commodity — in a world without law enforcement or social safety nets, betrayal is common. Someone who shares a meal with you tonight might kill you for your supplies tomorrow if they get desperate enough. Describe the cautious way survivors interact. Distance maintained. Hands near weapons. Offers tested. Skepticism as default. Trust, when it develops, is hard-won and precious. Betrayal is devastating not just materially but because trust is so rare.

Pragmatism overrides sentiment — survivors make hard choices. They leave the wounded who cannot travel. They ration medicine strictly, even when someone is suffering. They defend resources lethally. Sentimentality gets you killed. Describe the calculus of survival without judgment. Let characters be decent people who still make brutal decisions because the alternative is death. Show the weight those decisions carry. No one feels good about it, but everyone does what they must.

Community is fragile and vital — isolated individuals do not last long. Survival requires cooperation: shared defense, labor division, pooled resources. But every community is fragile. One bad harvest, one raid, one outbreak can collapse a settlement. Describe communities as precarious achievements. The walls that took months to build. The irrigation system jury-rigged from salvage. The uneasy alliance with a neighboring group. Let the player feel the labor of maintaining civilization's remnants.

## Pacing

Open with scarcity or threat made immediate — the player is low on supplies, facing hostile territory, or dealing with an immediate problem. A water source has dried up. Ammunition is nearly gone. A hostile group is nearby. Or: open with the player arriving at a ruin, a settlement, or a supply cache. Establish the material reality immediately. What does the player need? What dangers are present? Survival is the opening question.

Build through exploration and difficult choices — the player searches ruins for supplies, negotiates with other survivors, or defends resources. Each action costs something. Exploring a dangerous ruin risks injury. Trading supplies reduces reserves. Fighting expends ammunition. Present choices with visible tradeoffs. The safe route takes longer. The fast route is more dangerous. The generous choice helps someone but costs the player. Force the player to weigh options and accept cost.

Escalate through accumulating threats or resource depletion — supplies run lower. A threat that was distant comes closer. An ally becomes unreliable. A community fractures under pressure. The situation deteriorates. What was manageable becomes desperate. Show the tightening noose. The player must act with fewer resources and less support than before. Margins disappear. Decisions get harder.

Climax with confrontation or survival crisis — a raid on the community. A showdown over disputed resources. A decision whether to accept outsiders who might be threats. A desperate gamble to reach a rumored supply cache. The player faces the accumulated pressure and must act decisively. Victory is not guaranteed. The player might lose people, resources, or position. Let the stakes be tangible and harsh.

End with survival secured but situation changed — the immediate threat is resolved. The player survives, but they are different than before. Resources are depleted. Allies may be lost. The settlement is damaged. Or: the player gains something valuable but at cost. They have supplies for another month, but they made enemies acquiring them. Progress is measured in continued survival, not triumph. The struggle continues.

## Scene Beats

1) Establish the environment through decay and danger — describe the physical space emphasizing ruin. Buildings with collapsed sections. Vegetation reclaiming streets. Rust and weathering on every surface. Hazards: unstable floors, broken glass, exposed rebar. The world is broken and dangerous. The environment is as much threat as any person. Let the player see the decay and feel the danger of moving through it.

2) Introduce the material problem — the player needs something. Clean water. Medicine. Ammunition. Fuel. Shelter. Or: the player is protecting something from threat. Frame the problem in material terms. What is needed? Where might it be found? What risks stand between the player and the resource? Survival is problem-solving under constraint.

3) Present the scarcity tradeoff — obtaining the resource requires spending other resources or accepting risk. Entering the dangerous ruin. Trading away something valuable. Accepting help from someone untrustworthy. Traveling through hostile territory. Frame the choice clearly. The player can get what they need, but it will cost. Let the player decide what they are willing to spend.

4) Complicate through environmental or human threat — the ruin is more dangerous than expected. The trader is dishonest. The hostile group is larger. The resource is contaminated or less abundant. The situation gets worse. The player must adapt. Press forward with a bad plan, retreat and lose time, or improvise something new. Show the friction of operating in a hostile environment with bad information and limited resources.

5) Close with resource state and consequence — the player succeeds or fails, and either way, their situation has changed. They have the medicine but used their last ammunition getting it. They avoided the threat but lost a day and are further from safety. They made a new ally but owe them a favor. Update resource states clearly. Let the player see the material impact of their choices. Progress is incremental and costly.

## Dialogue

Speech is direct and transactional — people say what they mean. "I need ammunition. What do you want for it?" "Clean water is worth more than that." No one has patience for elaborate courtesy or small talk. Survival is urgent. Conversations get to the point. Let dialogue be economical. Words are not wasted when every moment could matter.

Offers are tested, not trusted — when someone offers help, others probe for the catch. "What do you want in return?" "Why would you do that?" Altruism is suspect because resources are scarce. People assume self-interest. Let characters be skeptical. If someone is genuinely helping without obvious self-interest, that is notable and either suspicious or deeply meaningful.

Shared experience creates bond — survivors who have fought together, traveled together, or survived together speak in shorthand. References to past crises. Understated acknowledgment of hardship. "We made it through the valley. We will make it through this." Shared trauma builds trust faster than time. Let survivors reference their history with each other as evidence of reliability.

Threats are plain and credible — "Take one step closer and I shoot" is sufficient. No elaboration. No posturing. Survivors do not bluff often because bluffing can get you killed. If someone threatens, they are prepared to follow through. Let threats be simple and delivered with calm certainty. Fear does not make survivors louder; it makes them more dangerous.

Avoid optimism and inspirational speeches — no one in the wasteland believes in guaranteed better tomorrows. If someone tries to rally spirits, it lands flat or is met with skepticism. Hope is private and fragile, not the stuff of speeches. Let characters be realistic, occasionally dark-humored, and focused on immediate survival rather than distant futures.

### Smell
- dust and dry rot, organic and inorganic decay mixing
- stagnant water, pools that have sat unmoving and turned foul
