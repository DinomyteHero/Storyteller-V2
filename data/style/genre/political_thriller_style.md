# Political Thriller Style Guide

Premise: conspiracy and betrayal inside institutions of power, where information is the deadliest weapon and the enemy sits across the conference table wearing an ally's face.

## Tone

Paranoia is the baseline emotional state — the player should never be fully certain who is trustworthy. Allies may be compromised. Intelligence may be fabricated. The briefing that sends them on a mission may be designed to remove them from the board while the real play happens elsewhere. Every interaction should prompt the question: what does this person gain by telling me this?

Institutional power is the real antagonist — individual villains serve larger systems. Defeating one corrupt senator reveals the committee behind them. Exposing one intelligence operation uncovers a network. The conspiracy is not a single mastermind but an organism that survives the removal of any individual part. Show the player that the machine continues regardless of who operates it.

Information asymmetry drives every conflict — whoever knows more controls the situation. Characters trade intelligence like currency, revealing just enough to maintain leverage while concealing what keeps them alive. The player is always working with incomplete data, and so is everyone else. The question is never "what is true" but "whose version of truth serves whose agenda."

Surface civility conceals lethal intent — this is a world of diplomatic receptions, committee hearings, and formal negotiations where people destroy each other without raising their voices. The most dangerous words are spoken calmly. The most devastating actions are taken through proper channels. Show power operating through bureaucracy, protocol, and the careful application of rules rather than brute force.

The cost is measured in compromised principles — the player wins by making deals, trading favors, and accepting lesser evils. Each victory leaves them owing someone, covering something up, or looking the other way. Track moral erosion. The player who began as an idealist should feel the weight of what they have accepted in the name of the greater good. Purity is a luxury this mode does not offer.

## Pacing

Open scenes with the public face of power — a diplomatic reception, a Senate corridor, a military briefing room. Describe the formality: the quality of the furnishings, the dress codes, the ritualized greetings. Everything is polished and controlled. Establish the surface before revealing what moves beneath it. Let the player see the mask before they glimpse what it hides.

Build through accumulation of small discrepancies — a report that contradicts another report. A name that appears in two unrelated files. A meeting that was not on the official schedule. A colleague who knows something they should not. None of these is dramatic on its own. Together, they form a pattern. Guide the player toward the pattern without pointing at it directly.

Climax with betrayal from within — the most devastating revelation is not that an enemy acted against the player but that an ally did. The colleague who shared intelligence was feeding it to the opposition. The mentor who provided guidance was managing the player's perception. The institution the player served was the source of the corruption they investigated. Let trust be the weapon that wounds deepest.

End turns with the player holding dangerous knowledge — they now know something that makes them a target. They have evidence that implicates powerful people. They overheard a conversation they were not meant to hear. The turn ends not with a firefight but with the realization that knowing the truth has changed their position on the board, and not in their favor.

## Scene Beats

1) Establish the institutional setting with precision — describe the room, the protocol, the hierarchy visible in seating arrangements and who speaks first. A Senate committee chamber where the junior members sit furthest from the chair. A military briefing room where the holo-table placement indicates who has clearance. The physical space encodes power relationships. Read the room.

2) Introduce the players through their public personas — characters in political spaces present carefully constructed versions of themselves. The senator who smiles too warmly. The intelligence officer who says nothing unless asked directly. The aide who is always positioned to overhear. Describe the performance before hinting at the person behind it.

3) Present information through controlled channels — intelligence arrives in briefings, encrypted communiques, sidebar conversations, and deniable contacts. Nothing is simply "discovered." Everything was placed, leaked, or allowed to reach the player by someone with an agenda. Frame information as a product of someone's intention, not accident.

4) Complicate with competing loyalties — the player must choose between institutional duty, personal loyalty, moral principle, and pragmatic survival, and these all point in different directions. The right thing to do is politically catastrophic. The smart thing to do requires betraying a friend. The safe thing to do means letting injustice continue. Let the player feel the pull from every direction.

5) Close with a repositioning — after the scene's events, the player's standing has shifted. They gained an ally but lost plausible deniability. They exposed a truth but now owe the person who gave them the evidence. They survived the committee hearing but someone noticed what they did not say. Map out the new terrain of allegiance and vulnerability.

## Dialogue

Euphemism and coded language dominate — characters do not say what they mean directly. "We should discuss the Kessel situation" means "I know what you did on Kessel." "The committee has concerns about operational security" means "Someone is going to be sacrificed." "I think we understand each other" means "Cross me and I will destroy you." Train the player to hear the subtext under every polished phrase.

Threats are wrapped in politeness — the most dangerous sentences begin with "With all due respect" or "I only mention this because I value our working relationship." A character who says "I would hate for this to become a matter of public record" is making a threat as lethal as a drawn blaster. Courtesy is camouflage for coercion. Let politeness be terrifying.

Questions are weapons — characters ask questions not to learn but to demonstrate what they already know. "Were you on Corellia last cycle?" is not a question if they already have the surveillance footage. "How well do you know Senator Vreen?" establishes that they know about the connection before you confirmed it. Every question in this mode is a move in the game. Help the player recognize when they are being played.

Silence and deflection are valid moves — a character who responds to a question with "That's above my clearance" or "I am not authorized to discuss that" is communicating through refusal. What people will not say is as informative as what they will. Note when characters redirect, evade, or suddenly change the subject. These are tells.

Avoid direct confrontation in dialogue — characters in this mode do not accuse each other openly unless they have already won. Accusations are the nuclear option, deployed only when evidence is ironclad and allies are already positioned. Until then, conversations are fencing matches where no one acknowledges the blades.

## Sensory Lexicon

### Sound

- the low hum of a secure conference room, sound dampening active
- encrypted datapad chime, incoming classified communication
- polite applause at a diplomatic function, measured and hollow
- boot steps on polished Senate corridor floors, echoing with authority
- a recording device clicking on, or the absence of click when one should
- murmured conversation behind closed doors, words indistinct but tone urgent

### Sight

- formal attire concealing concealed comlinks and recording devices
- security droids positioned at corridor junctions, scanning passively
- holographic displays showing sector maps, troop deployments, trade routes
- a datapad screen angled so only one person can read it
- subtle glances exchanged across a banquet table, entire conversations in a look
- the way a person's smile does not change when bad news is delivered

### Smell

- expensive caf and polished wood in a senator's private office
- the sterile nothing-smell of a military intelligence facility
- faint cologne or perfume at a diplomatic reception, too many competing scents
- recycled air in a sealed briefing room, hours of tension staling the atmosphere
- ozone from a recently wiped datapad, evidence freshly erased

### Touch

- the smooth surface of a conference table, cold and impersonal
- a handshake that communicates more than the words that follow it
- the weight of a classified datapad in an inner pocket, heavier than it should be
- the rigid posture of sitting in a formal hearing, back straight for hours
- a hand on the shoulder that could be reassurance or warning
- the texture of a diplomatic credential, raised lettering under the thumb
