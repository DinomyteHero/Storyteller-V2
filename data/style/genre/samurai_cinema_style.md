# Samurai Cinema Style Guide

Premise: patient stillness erupting into single decisive strikes, where honor is a burden carried in silence and duty devours personal desire.

## Tone

Restraint defines every scene in this mode — characters do not explain themselves, do not justify their choices, and do not raise their voices except in the instant before death. Power is communicated through what is withheld: the hand that rests near the vibroblade hilt, the bow that lasts one beat too long, the gaze that holds steady when everyone else looks away. Silence is the loudest statement a character can make.

Honor operates as weight, not glory — characters bound by codes of loyalty move through the world burdened by promises they cannot break and debts they cannot repay. A warrior who has sworn service does not celebrate that oath; they endure it. Show honor as something that narrows a person's choices until only the hardest path remains. The player should feel the cost of keeping their word.

The used-galaxy texture of Star Wars grounds this aesthetic in weathered reality — durasteel is pitted and scarred, robes are travel-stained, and vibroblades bear the marks of previous owners. Nothing is ornate for its own sake. Beauty exists in function, in the precise geometry of a well-maintained weapon or the stark architecture of a monastery carved into asteroid rock.

Avoid spectacle and excess — this mode rejects the impulse to fill scenes with noise, crowds, and constant motion. A single figure standing in a corridor is more powerful than a battalion charging. One vibroblade drawn slowly from its sheath carries more weight than a dozen blasters firing. Economy of detail creates intensity.

Duty versus personal desire is the engine of tragedy here — the warrior who loves someone they must oppose, the retainer who sees their lord's corruption but cannot speak, the exile who longs for home but is bound to wander. Every character should carry an unresolved tension between what they want and what they owe.

## Pacing

Open scenes with extended stillness and environmental observation — three to five lines of landscape, weather, light, and atmosphere before any character acts or speaks. Let the world breathe. Describe the wind moving across a landing platform, the quality of light through transparisteel, the distant hum of a city heard from a high place. Ground the player in physical space before introducing tension.

Build tension through micro-details rather than escalating action — a hand shifting position, a change in breathing, the angle of a shadow. These small movements signal approaching violence or decision more effectively than overt threats. Train the player to read stillness as charged, not empty.

Resolve conflicts in a single decisive moment after long buildup — one strike, one word, one choice that ends the standoff. Do not extend combat sequences into drawn-out exchanges. The preparation is the scene; the resolution is a single beat. A duel between skilled opponents may last one paragraph of setup and one sentence of conclusion.

End turns with the aftermath of action, not the action itself — show the consequence, the silence that follows the strike, the body settling, the wind resuming. Linger on what the moment cost rather than what it accomplished. The player processes the weight of what just happened before choosing what comes next.

## Scene Beats

1) Establish the space with a wide environmental frame — describe the landscape or architecture as if seen from a distance, emphasizing weather, light, and emptiness. A mesa overlooking a desert basin. A monastery perched on a cliff above cloud cover. A rain-slicked landing pad at dusk. Place the player in a world that dwarfs individual concerns.

2) Narrow focus to a single telling detail — after the wide frame, close in on one specific object or sensation that anchors the scene: a cup of tea cooling on a stone ledge, a vibroblade laid across a folded cloth, the sound of footsteps approaching on gravel. This detail should carry thematic weight.

3) Introduce the human element through posture and position — characters enter scenes through their physical presence, not their dialogue. Describe how they stand, where they place their hands, whether they face the player or look away. Body language communicates allegiance, threat, respect, and grief before a single word is spoken.

4) Present the confrontation as a question of principle, not tactics — the choice is not "fight or flee" but "honor your oath or follow your heart," "spare the defeated enemy or fulfill your promise to the dead," "speak truth to power or protect someone through silence." Frame decisions around values, not outcomes.

5) Resolve with economy — one action, one sentence, one consequence. Then silence. Let the player sit with what happened.

## Dialogue

Dialogue is sparse and formal — characters speak in short, deliberate sentences with no filler words, no casual contractions, and no humor except the driest irony. A warrior might say "I have come" rather than explaining why. Questions are answered with the minimum necessary words, and sometimes with only a look or a gesture.

Silence functions as dialogue — when a character does not respond, that silence carries meaning. Describe the pause, the shift in posture, the decision not to speak. "She said nothing" is a complete and powerful line of dialogue in this mode. Use it. Let conversations have gaps that the player must interpret.

Loaded pauses and incomplete sentences convey what words cannot — a character who begins "If things had been different--" and stops is communicating more than a paragraph of exposition. Ellipses and trailing statements suggest depths of feeling that direct speech would cheapen. Restraint in language mirrors restraint in action.

Formal address and titles carry weight — characters use titles, honorifics, and formal modes of address even with people they know intimately. Dropping formality is a significant dramatic event. When a master calls a student by their first name instead of their title, that shift means something has fundamentally changed.

Avoid modern conversational patterns entirely — no banter, no quips, no rapid-fire exchanges. Every line of dialogue should feel as though the speaker considered it before speaking. Words are commitments in this mode, not casual currency.

## Sensory Lexicon

### Sound
- wind across open ground, low sustained moan through canyon walls
- vibroblade drawn from sheath, the faint ring of durasteel on leather
- single footstep on stone, gravel shift, boot on wet deck plate
- silence after a blaster shot, ringing absence of sound
- distant engine hum like a held breath, docking clamp settling
- rain striking duracrete, each drop distinct in the quiet

### Sight
- wide horizon line, sky meeting desert or ocean at the edge of vision
- single figure silhouetted against a viewport or sunset
- dust motes suspended in a shaft of light through damaged hull plating
- the slow arc of a vibroblade catching light as it is drawn
- stillness of a face revealing nothing, eyes steady and dark
- wet stone, rain-slicked landing pads reflecting nav lights

### Smell
- wet stone and mineral dust after rain on a dry world
- oiled durasteel, the clean sharp scent of a maintained blade
- incense or burnt herbs in a meditation chamber
- ozone lingering after a single blaster discharge
- cold mountain air through an open hangar, thin and clean

### Touch
- the weight of a vibroblade in the hand, balanced and familiar
- rough-woven robes against skin, travel-worn fabric
- cold wind on exposed face, the sting of dust carried in it
- smooth stone worn by centuries of footsteps in a temple corridor
- the sudden absence of tension in the body after a strike is completed
- rain on bare hands, each drop a distinct cold point
