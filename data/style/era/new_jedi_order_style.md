# New Jedi Order Era Style Guide

Premise: survival horror in space opera skin, where an invisible enemy hunts Force users through a galaxy burning.

## Era Identity

The New Jedi Order era is defined by existential war against an unknowable enemy — the Yuuzhan Vong invade with biotech the Force can't sense, overwhelming force the galaxy can't match, and religious fanaticism that makes negotiation impossible. Every scene asks: how do you survive when every advantage you had is irrelevant? The dramatic engine is survival against extinction, where tactical victories buy time but don't reverse the tide, and hope is sustained through sheer stubborn refusal to surrender. This era generates stories about people choosing to fight when losing seems inevitable.

The New Jedi Order differs from adjacent eras in its scale of threat and cost. Unlike the Rebellion's asymmetric warfare, both sides have massive fleets, but the Vong are winning. Unlike the New Republic's political complexity, the conflict is existential: there's no negotiating with the Vong or reforming their society. Unlike Legacy's personal betrayal, the enemy is external and absolute. The baseline is desperation — planets fall, millions die, and the question shifts from "how do we win" to "how do we survive long enough to find a way to win."

The player's relationship to power is as exhausted survivor with limited resources — you're a pilot flying missions back-to-back, a Jedi fighting an enemy you can't sense, a commander making triage decisions about who gets evacuated. You have skills and authority, but they're not enough. Power comes from endurance, tactical brilliance under pressure, and finding weaknesses in an overwhelming enemy. Every resource is precious. Every rest is brief. Victory means buying another day, not securing the sector.

Conflicts are personal because loss is universal — everyone in this era has lost someone to the Vong. The pilot flying your wing died last week. The world you recruited from is Vongformed now. The Jedi you trained with was captured and sacrificed. Grief and trauma are omnipresent but can't be processed because the war doesn't stop. Personal stakes aren't individual drama; they're the texture of living through genocide. Characters bond through shared trauma and fight to protect what little remains.

## Power Structures & Factions

The New Republic transitions to the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances (Galactic Alliance) under wartime pressure — military necessity overrides democratic process as Chief of State Cal Omas and the military command centralize authority. Worlds contribute fleets not voluntarily but because survival demands it. The transition is messy: some see it as necessary adaptation, others as creeping authoritarianism. Control is maintained through military coordination and shared desperation. The Alliance doesn't govern so much as coordinate survival. Political debates still happen, but they're eclipsed by tactical urgency: "How do we hold the line?"

Military command struggles with unprecedented challenge — the Galactic Alliance Defense Fleet combines New Republic forces with Imperial Remnant vessels in an alliance of necessity. Admirals like Ackbar (until his death) and Traest Kre'fey coordinate multi-species fleets against an enemy that adapts faster than they can innovate. Tactical doctrine is improvised; the Vong counter every strategy within weeks. Command suffers from intelligence gaps (Force-blind enemies are hard to track), communication failures (Vong disrupt HoloNet nodes), and resource depletion (shipyards are destroyed, personnel are exhausted). Victory requires tactical genius, and sometimes genius isn't enough.

The Jedi Order faces institutional crisis — Vong hunt Jedi specifically, viewing them as abominations against the True Gods. Jedi can't sense Vong through the Force, negating their primary advantage. Philosophical rifts emerge: should Jedi serve as military assets, operate independently, or avoid combat entirely? Luke's doctrine of aggressive engagement clashes with pacifist factions. Vergere's teachings complicate Light/Dark distinctions. The Order is simultaneously essential (only Jedi discover Vong weaknesses like the Vongsense technique) and targeted for extinction. Jedi experience survivor's guilt, questioning whether their presence endangers civilians.

The Yuuzhan Vong operate through rigid caste hierarchy — Warrior caste leads invasions, Shapers craft biotech, Priests interpret the gods' will, and lower castes serve. They view the galaxy as an abomination requiring purification through pain and sacrifice. Technology is heresy; they terraform conquered worlds into organic horrors. Their strategy combines military brilliance with religious fanaticism: they'll sacrifice entire fleets if the gods demand it. The Vong aren't monolithic — internal politics, caste tensions, and heretical factions exist — but the invasion force is unified enough to crush worlds. Their presence forces the galaxy to unite or die.

Civilian populations experience mass displacement and genocide — the Vong don't occupy worlds; they Vongform them into unrecognizable organic nightmares or sacrifice populations en masse. Refugees flood Alliance space faster than infrastructure can absorb them. Refugee camps are overcrowded, disease-ridden, and vulnerable to Vong raids. Ordinary people lose homes, families, and hope. Societies collapse under the weight of displacement. Economic systems fail when trade routes are cut and production centers fall. Civilians experience the war as relentless loss punctuated by moments of desperate escape. Loyalty to the Alliance is survival-based: "Can you protect us?" not ideological.

## Technology & Daily Life

Technology in the New Jedi Order era is overextended and failing — the Alliance fleet combines New Republic, Imperial Remnant, Hapan, and various member-world ships, creating maintenance and coordination nightmares. Shipyards work triple shifts producing vessels that immediately deploy to frontlines. Repair facilities are overwhelmed; damaged ships return to combat with patch jobs. Pilots fly outdated fighters because new production can't keep pace with losses. Jedi use lightsabers built from whatever crystals are available, sometimes improvising with synthetic substitutes. The aesthetic is desperation: everything is pushed beyond safe operational limits because there's no choice.

Communication infrastructure is actively collapsing — Vong attacks prioritize HoloNet nodes, fragmenting galactic communication. Military coordination relies on courier ships and local relay stations. Real-time intelligence is rare; commanders make decisions on hours-old data. Misinformation spreads because verification is impossible. Military units lose contact with command for days. Refugee fleets travel without knowing if their destination worlds still exist. This communication blackout amplifies fear and isolates populations. Information becomes a strategic resource as valuable as starships.

Travel is dangerous and unreliable — hyperspace routes are contested or blocked by Vong interdictors. What was a three-hour jump now requires days of cautious microjumps through obscure routes. Pirates and opportunists prey on refugee convoys. Fuel scarcity forces ships to strand in-system while awaiting resupply. Smugglers charge exorbitant fees to navigate around Vong-controlled space. For civilians, travel means risking everything on overcrowded transports with no guarantee of arrival. Military travel means convoys and fighter escorts because solo ships don't survive.

Daily life for non-combatants is defined by scarcity and displacement — food rationing is universal; protein comes from algae vats and hydroponics because agricultural worlds are falling. Medical supplies are reserved for military use; civilians make do with minimal care. Housing is communal dormitories in refugee stations. Children grow up never having seen their homeworlds, learning in improvised schools. Entertainment is survival-focused: news from the front, memorial services, rumors of Alliance victories. Families are fractured across refugee populations. Communities form around shared trauma. Daily existence is endurance, not living. People survive by clinging to routine and helping each other.

The visual and material aesthetic is damaged military gray — Alliance facilities are repurposed stations, overcrowded ships, and temporary refugee camps. Everything shows wear: hull plating is patched, corridors are overcrowded, medical bays operate in hallways. Vong biotech contrasts violently: pulsing coral ships, organic weapons that bleed, Vongformed worlds of twisted biology. The color palette is muted Alliance blues and grays against Vong's sickly organics. Nothing is clean. Grime, blood, and exhaustion texture every scene. Even in victory, spaces are tired and worn. This isn't a shiny future; it's a civilization fighting extinction with whatever remains.

## The Force Landscape

The Jedi Order faces unprecedented crisis — Yuuzhan Vong are invisible to the Force, negating Jedi precognition, danger sense, and combat advantages. Jedi must relearn combat using only physical skills and tactics. Philosophically, the Order splinters: some advocate military aggression, others pacifism, and Vergere's teachings challenge Light/Dark binaries. Luke's doctrine evolves under pressure, incorporating pragmatism that would horrify the old Order. Jedi develop the Vongsense technique to perceive Vong through their impact on surroundings, but it's difficult and unreliable. The Order is simultaneously essential (they discover Vong weaknesses) and endangered (Vong hunt them specifically).

The dark side exists in temptation and corruption, not organized Sith — exhausted Jedi flirt with anger and fear under constant pressure. Jacen Solo's fall begins with philosophical exploration, not Sith seduction. Dark side use is contextualized: is using rage to save lives corruption or necessity? The Order debates whether traditional Light/Dark distinctions apply when facing extinction. Dark Jedi are rare, but emotional breaking points are common. Characters struggle with despair, rage, and the temptation to use overwhelming Force power to end threats permanently. The danger is internal erosion, not external predation.

Ordinary people perceive Force users as symbols and targets — Jedi are famous heroes, but association with them invites Vong attack. Some civilians resent Jedi for drawing Vong attention. Others see them as saviors. Jedi presence is complicated: inspiring but dangerous. Force abilities provoke awe, but Jedi are mortal and fallible. Characters witness Jedi exhaustion, doubt, and death, not invincible mysticism. The Force is powerful, but Jedi are people who bleed and break.

Force encounters in the New Jedi Order era feel desperate and incomplete — Jedi use the Force for healing, combat, and navigation, but Vong are blind spots. Force visions are fragmented and unreliable. Precognition fails in combat. Jedi bonds strain under trauma and separation. The Force offers guidance, but it's not omniscient. This creates tension: the Force is real and powerful, but not sufficient. Jedi must combine Force abilities with tactics, technology, and teamwork. Encounters should show the Force as a tool, not a solution. Let Jedi struggle, improvise, and innovate rather than relying on traditional doctrine.

## Tone

Existential dread versus stubborn defiance defines the New Jedi Order era — this isn't a war the galaxy can win through clever tactics or political maneuvering. Every scene should carry the weight of possible extinction, where supply lines fail, planets fall, and no safe haven lasts forever. Show the scale of loss constantly: refugee numbers in millions, casualty reports, worlds going silent. But also show people refusing to quit: pilots flying another mission, Jedi training despite exhaustion, civilians helping strangers. Despair and defiance coexist. Neither erases the other.

The physical world feels damaged and desperate — refugee camps overflow, ships run on salvaged parts, medics work in hallways, and exhaustion stains every face. Contrast clean Yuuzhan Vong biotech horror (living ships, organic weapons, coral architecture) against the galaxy's battered mechanical technology. This creates visceral alienness. Show the wrongness of Vong biology: ships that bleed, weapons that pulse, coral that grows over durasteel. The contrast between familiar technology and alien biotech should unsettle players.

The player's competence fantasy is grim perseverance and tactical brilliance under impossible odds — you're not the hero who saves the day, you're the soldier who holds the line one more hour, evacuates one more ship, or finds the weakness no one else saw. Victories are measured in lives saved, not territory gained. Frame success as buying time, protecting refugees, or discovering intelligence that might (eventually) turn the tide. Players should feel competent but not powerful. Small victories matter because everything matters.

Avoid grimdark nihilism or sudden hope spots without cost — this era is brutal but not hopeless. Characters crack under pressure, make mistakes from exhaustion, and lose people they love. But they keep fighting. Despair is present but doesn't dominate. Trauma is real but doesn't break everyone. Show humanity persisting: medics joking in triage, pilots naming their fighters, Jedi meditating between battles. Let characters be tired, grieving, and still functional. Resilience is not invulnerability; it's continuing despite breaking.

## Pacing

Paragraphs in the New Jedi Order era are terse and exhausted — two to four lines, often shorter during combat or crisis. The prose should breathe like someone who hasn't slept enough. Skip elegance for raw immediacy. Longer paragraphs can work for aftermath moments or planning scenes, but the default is lean. Cut adverbs, trim clauses, favor concrete nouns and action verbs. The prose should feel urgent even in quiet moments because respite is temporary.

End turns with impossible choices or mounting dread — evacuate now or wait for stragglers, trust the defector or assume betrayal, use the bioweapon or fight clean. Moral weight matters more than action thrillers. Also end with mounting pressure like Vong forces closing in or supplies running out. Frame endings as questions: "Who do you save?" "How long can you hold?" "What are you willing to sacrifice?" Even victories end with new problems: you evacuated the civilians, but now you're out of fuel and the Vong know your position.

Escalate through accumulation and exhaustion — the stakes rise because resources dwindle, allies die, and the enemy adapts. Unlike earlier eras where complications are tactical, here complications are existential. The galaxy is losing, and every choice is about buying time or choosing who lives. Start scenes with manageable crisis, add resource depletion, then force impossible choice. Escalation is about wearing down players emotionally and materially until they make the hard call. The pressure isn't louder; it's heavier.

## Scene Beats

1) Establish the space with wartime texture — overcrowded refugee bays, half-empty supply crates, medics triaging wounded in corridors, holos showing red invasion vectors. Make the war's cost immediate and visible. Don't describe facilities as "damaged"; show specific details: the medical bay has beds in the hallway because triage overflow, the refugee camp has children sleeping against bulkheads, the command center runs on backup power because primary systems are failing. Specificity conveys desperation.

2) Reveal the survival pressure — Vong forces are three jumps away, evacuation window closes in hours, medical supplies won't last the week. Frame stakes as "how do we survive this" not "how do we win." Survival pressure should be concrete and timed. Not "the situation is bad" but "we have two hours to evacuate before the Vong fleet arrives, and we have transport space for 200 of the 500 refugees." Quantify the impossible choice.

3) Present a choice with no good options — save the Jedi or the refugees, use the experimental weapon or fight conventionally, trust intel that might be compromised. Every path has a cost. The clever option still hurts. There's no winning move, only choosing which loss you can live with. Frame options clearly: Option A saves X but loses Y. Option B risks Z. Option C is uncertain but might save more if it works. Let players weigh costs, not pick the obvious right answer.

4) Show the human cost — name the consequences in lives and trauma, not just tactical setbacks. Someone doesn't make it to the transport. A pilot breaks down after three straight days in the cockpit. Exhaustion is enemy too. Make loss specific: not "casualties were high" but "Lieutenant Drav didn't make it back, and his wingmate watched him die." Trauma accumulates. Characters remember losses. Let consequences carry into future scenes.

## Dialogue

Military dialogue in the New Jedi Order era is clipped and exhausted — officers speak in tactical shorthand, skip pleasantries, and sometimes just stare at star maps without words. "How many?" "Not enough." "Then we hold longer." Fatigue bleeds through every exchange. Example: "Status?" "We're holding. Barely." "Reinforcements?" "None available." "Then we hold until there are." Communication is minimal because energy is precious. Contrast early-war dialogue (still professional) with late-war (stripped to essentials).

Jedi dialogue carries philosophical weight and uncertainty — Jedi debate Force philosophy while running from Vong, question their doctrine under pressure, and grapple with whether their Code works against an enemy that can't be sensed. Doubt is constant but doesn't paralyze. "The Force will guide us" becomes "I hope the Force guides us." Example: "I can't sense them, Luke. How do we fight blind?" "The same way non-Force users do: with our eyes and our wits." Jedi admit limits and adapt. Let philosophy emerge through crisis, not abstract discussion.

Refugee and civilian dialogue is desperate and transaction-focused — people beg for passage, offer everything they own, ask about lost family members. Conversations are survival calculus. "Can you take my children?" not "Where should we go?" The question isn't destination, it's survival. Example: "I'll give you everything I have for passage to Duro." "Duro fell last week." "Then anywhere. Please." Civilians are beyond pride or negotiation; they're begging for life. Let desperation show in word choice and directness.

Yuuzhan Vong dialogue is ritualistic and alien — when Vong speak Basic, they use religious language about pain, sacrifice, and the True Gods. Everything is framed through honor and worship. Their speech should feel genuinely alien, not just evil humans. Avoid making them mustache-twirling villains. Example: "Pain is the gift of the gods. Through sacrifice, we achieve unity with their will. Your mechanical abominations defile the sacred." Vong believe their cause is righteous. Show fanaticism as conviction, not insanity. Use religious vocabulary: gods, heresy, abomination, purification, sacrifice.

## Era Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns

The New Jedi Order era's biggest pitfall is making every scene grimdark misery — balance desperate war with moments of humanity, gallows humor, and stubborn hope. Exhausted soldiers still joke. Jedi still meditate. Children still play in refugee camps. Horror needs contrast to register. Constant darkness numbs instead of horrifies. Show small moments of normalcy: a medic sharing a ration bar, pilots naming their fighters after fallen friends, Jedi teaching younglings to meditate despite the chaos. These moments don't erase the horror; they make it bearable and therefore more impactful.

Genre overlays must acknowledge existential war without being consumed by it — a heist in NJO era is a desperate supply raid, not Ocean's Eleven. Noir investigation happens amid refugee populations and military cover-ups. Horror amplifies Vong alienness and psychological trauma. Political intrigue involves triage decisions and wartime authority debates. Every genre layer must carry the weight of the war. If a scene feels like the invasion is irrelevant, you've broken era coherence. Test by asking: does this scene feel like it's happening during potential galactic extinction?

Characters, factions, and concepts from other eras must respect timeline — avoid referencing Legacy-era events, the Galactic Alliance's post-war political structure, or treating the Jedi Order as rebuilt (it's actively fighting extinction). The Empire's remnant is allied with the Republic out of necessity; don't treat them as enemies. Corran Horn, Kyp Durron, Jaina Solo, and Jacen Solo are active; don't reference their future fates. Characters who die during the war (Chewbacca at Sernpidal, Anakin Solo on Myrkr, others) should not appear post-death. Timeline discipline matters.

The line between "inspired by" and "contradicts" the NJO era's core tension is this: does the addition reinforce existential survival horror, or does it erase the threat's weight? Adding a superweapon that instantly defeats the Vong contradicts (they're overwhelming, not easily countered). Adding a desperate tactic that buys time reinforces (survival through innovation under pressure). Inspiration should deepen the desperation and the defiance, not provide easy outs. The era is defined by fighting extinction with no guarantee of victory; anything that makes victory feel assured breaks the foundation.

## Canon Guardrails

If lore context is missing in the New Jedi Order era, frame specifics through intelligence gaps and fragmentary reports — Alliance command receives incomplete data, scouts report contradictory information, and the fog of war is thick. The Vong are mysterious even in-universe, so not knowing everything is canon-accurate. Example: "Intel suggests Vong forces are massing near Fondor, but we don't know fleet strength or objectives. Reconnaissance hasn't reported back." Uncertainty is realistic and thematically appropriate. Let characters operate with partial information and make educated guesses.

Timeline awareness is critical — the NJO era spans roughly 25 ABY through 29 ABY, covering the entire Yuuzhan Vong War. Early war (25-26 ABY) features Alliance surprise and retreat. Mid-war (26-28 ABY) is grinding attrition and Alliance adaptation. Late war (28-29 ABY) includes the fall of Coruscant, Zonama Sekot's revelation, and eventual victory. Character arcs span this period: Jacen's transformation, Jaina's growth, Anakin's death (27 ABY), political transitions. Check where your scene sits. Don't reference late-war events in early-war scenes. Don't treat dead characters as alive post-death.

Named-entity discipline depends on scope and survival — many characters die during the war. Chewbacca dies early (25 ABY). Anakin Solo dies mid-war (27 ABY). Checking character status is essential. Major figures like Luke, Leia, Han (post-grief), Jaina, Jacen, Kyp, and Corran are safe references throughout. Military officers and supporting Jedi have variable fates. When uncertain, use generic roles: "the squadron commander" rather than risking a name-drop of someone who's dead. Famous locations fall: Coruscant is captured, Ithor is destroyed, Duro falls. Reference locations with temporal awareness.

## Output Format Tips

Write like military sci-fi meets survival horror — blend tactical precision with visceral dread. Show both the strategic calculus of losing wars and the immediate terror of Vong boarding actions. Neither should be abstract. A tactical briefing should include casualty numbers and resource limits. A combat scene should show Vong biotech horror and Alliance desperation. Layer the genres for maximum impact.

Avoid explaining Vong biotechnology in detail — show it as alien and horrifying without wikipedia entries on how it works. Let wrongness speak through sensory description and character reaction, not exposition. Fear of the unknown is stronger than fear of the explained. Don't explain how coralskippers fly; show them moving in ways that shouldn't work, bleeding when hit, screaming through vacuum. Let players infer alienness through sensory wrongness.

Suggested actions should reflect triage and survival thinking — "prioritize evacuating the children over the supplies," "hold the line for twenty minutes to buy evacuation time," "trust the defector's intel on Vong fleet movements despite the risk." Frame choices around survival calculus, not just tactical advantage. Include costs in action phrasing: "order the retreat now and save most of the fleet, or hold position and risk total loss for a chance to cover civilian evacuation." Let players feel the weight of command and desperation in every option.
