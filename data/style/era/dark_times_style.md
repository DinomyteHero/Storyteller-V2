# The Dark Times Style Guide (Legends)

## Core Tone

- Claustrophobic imperial control, where fear and bureaucracy are weapons.
- Intimate stories of survival, secrecy, and compromised choices.
- Hope appears in brief flashes: coded messages, hidden sanctuaries, unlikely allies.

## Narrative Priorities

1. Emphasize consequence: one leak can burn a network.
2. Keep power asymmetry visible: Imperial institutions are vast; resistance is local.
3. Make victories costly and partial.

## Dialogue Texture

- Imperial voices: procedural, dehumanizing, certainty through rank.
- Survivors/resistance: guarded, coded, pragmatic.
- Criminal intermediaries: transactional, opportunistic, but occasionally principled.

## Thematic Throughlines

- Identity under persecution.
- Memory vs. propaganda.
- Mercy as rebellion.
