# Legacy Era Style Guide

Premise: family tragedy in galactic scope, where the people you trust are more dangerous than the enemies you fight.

## Era Identity

The Legacy era is defined by internal fracture and betrayal — allies become enemies, governments turn authoritarian, and heroes fall to darkness while believing they're saving the galaxy. Every scene asks: who can you trust when everyone has legitimate grievances and dangerous solutions? The dramatic engine is loyalty versus betrayal, where relationships built over decades strain and break under impossible pressures. This era generates stories about watching good people make terrible choices and navigating moral complexity where every side has a point.

The Legacy era differs from adjacent eras in its intimacy of conflict and absence of external existential threat. Unlike the New Jedi Order's Yuuzhan Vong invasion providing clear enemy, the Legacy era's threats come from within: Jacen Solo becomes Darth Caedus, the Galactic Alliance imprisons Jedi, and Force psychosis afflicts the Order. Unlike the Rebellion's moral clarity or New Republic's optimistic complexity, this era is characterized by tragic ambiguity — the antagonist is your nephew who genuinely believes authoritarian control prevents galactic collapse. The baseline is erosion: trust decays, alliances fracture, and families break.

The player's relationship to power is as investigator navigating conspiracy — you're a Jedi uncovering uncomfortable truths about the Order, a Alliance operative questioning your government's authoritarianism, or a Solo/Skywalker family member caught between loyalties. You have access and relationships, but those same connections complicate action. Power comes from understanding what's really happening, building evidence, and making hard choices about who to trust and who to oppose. You're not fighting obvious evil; you're navigating shades of grey where everyone thinks they're right.

Conflicts are personal because history is dense — when Jaina fights Jacen, it's not hero versus villain; it's siblings whose relationship spans three decades and a galactic war. When Jedi question Luke's leadership, they're not rebelling against authority; they're people who've followed him since youth now doubting his judgment. When the Alliance imprisons Jedi, it's not tyranny for tyranny's sake; it's officials genuinely afraid of Force users after watching Jacen's fall. Personal history makes every conflict tragic because there's no clean side, only impossible choices between people you know.

## Power Structures & Factions

The Galactic Alliance governs through increasingly authoritarian measures justified by security concerns — after the Yuuzhan Vong War devastated the galaxy, the Alliance centralized power to rebuild. Chief of State Cal Omas (then Jacen Solo as co-Chief of State, then Natasi Daala post-Jacen) wields emergency powers that were never rescinded. Senate oversight weakens as executive authority expands. Security checkpoints proliferate, surveillance intensifies, and dissent is framed as destabilization. The Alliance isn't cartoonishly evil; it's exhausted people prioritizing order over liberty because chaos killed billions. Officials genuinely believe restricting Jedi prevents another Jacen Solo. This creates moral complexity: their methods are wrong, but their fears are legitimate.

The Jedi Order fractures under internal and external pressure — Force psychosis afflicts Jedi seemingly at random, causing paranoid delusions and violent outbreaks. Luke's leadership is questioned: did his training methods fail Jacen? Should Jedi serve governments or operate independently? Philosophical splits emerge between Luke's establishment, Kyp Durron's aggressive faction, and younger Jedi who distrust all authority after Jacen's fall. The Order is simultaneously victim (Alliance imprisons Jedi) and perpetrator (Jacen was a Jedi Knight). External, Daala's government treats Jedi as threats requiring regulation. Internal, the Order debates whether to submit, resist, or reform. There's no unified Jedi voice; it's fractured perspectives competing for legitimacy.

Family power dynamics complicate political conflict — the Skywalker and Solo families have shaped galactic history for three generations. Luke founded the new Jedi Order; Leia is a respected senator and diplomat; Han is a war hero. Their influence opens doors but also paints targets. Jacen's fall as Darth Caedus devastates the family: Leia and Han lose their son, Luke questions his teaching, Jaina must kill her brother. Family gatherings are minefields of grief and blame. Political opponents leverage Skywalker/Solo mistakes as evidence against Jedi or Alliance policy. Being part of these families means every personal failure becomes public scandal and every public choice affects family bonds.

The Lost Tribe of the Sith emerges from millennia of isolation — descended from ancient Sith, they're sophisticated, philosophically developed, and coldly manipulative. Unlike ranting Sith Lords, the Lost Tribe practices subtlety: infiltration, seduction, and long-term planning. They see the galaxy as rightfully theirs and dark side philosophy as enlightenment. Their presence introduces external manipulation into already-fragile Alliance and Jedi politics. Characters like Vestara Khai complicate moral lines: she's Sith but young, intelligent, and capable of questioning her upbringing. The Lost Tribe isn't stupid evil; they're dangerous because they're smart and patient.

Civilian populations experience authoritarian drift with mixed reactions — Core Worlds that were devastated by the Vong War support Alliance security measures, viewing Jedi regulation as prudent oversight after Jacen's dictatorship. Outer Rim worlds resent Alliance overreach and see Jedi as protectors being persecuted. Public opinion fragments along regional and ideological lines. Some civilians fear Force users; others revere them. Economic recovery continues unevenly. Daily life improves materially (infrastructure rebuilt, trade restored) but civil liberties erode. Citizens experience the tension between security and freedom, often prioritizing the former because they remember starvation and invasion.

Loyalty and allegiance are tested constantly — Alliance officers must choose between following orders to imprison Jedi or protecting people they respect. Jedi must choose between Order solidarity and personal conscience. Family members must choose between blood and principle. No choice is clean. Supporting the Alliance means enabling authoritarianism. Opposing it means destabilizing fragile recovery. Protecting Jedi means harboring potential threats. Regulating Jedi means punishing the innocent with the dangerous. Characters navigate these contradictions by making provisional choices and living with consequences. Loyalty is conditional and renegotiated constantly.

## Technology & Daily Life

Technology in the Legacy era is recovered and improved post-Vong — the galaxy has rebuilt infrastructure destroyed during the war. Shipyards produce new vessels combining lessons learned from wartime innovation. Communication networks are restored and improved with redundant nodes. Medical technology advances driven by wartime triage necessity. Jedi use refined lightsaber construction techniques, sometimes incorporating ancient knowledge recovered during reconstruction. The aesthetic is recovered prosperity: cleaner than wartime desperation, more sophisticated than Rebellion-era improvisation, but carrying scars from recent trauma.

Communication infrastructure functions but is surveilled — the HoloNet operates efficiently across most Alliance space, but government monitoring is pervasive. Military and government channels are encrypted; civilian channels are assumed compromised. Jedi develop informal communication networks outside official channels to avoid surveillance. Information travels fast, but trust in that information is conditional. Intelligence agencies, both Alliance and Jedi, compete for information dominance. Secure conversation requires physical meetings in shielded rooms or encoded communications that might be cracked.

Travel is open but monitored — hyperspace routes are fully operational without the wartime interdiction and danger of the Vong era. But Alliance security checkpoints scan travelers, especially Jedi during Daala's administration. Travel permits are required in high-security sectors. Force users learn to mask their presence or travel under false credentials. Pirates and criminals are less prevalent than post-Empire eras; Alliance patrols are effective. Travel feels safe but watched. Characters experience this as bureaucratic annoyance or existential threat depending on their relationship with the Alliance government.

Daily life for non-combatants reflects post-war recovery and creeping authoritarianism — economic prosperity returns as trade routes reopen and production recovers. Employment is available; consumer goods flow. Children born after the war grow up in peace but under surveillance. Education includes both Alliance civics and warnings about Force user danger (in Daala's era). Entertainment media flourishes with diverse options. Communities rebuild social bonds fractured by wartime displacement. But political discussions are cautious; criticism of Alliance policy risks attention. The baseline is comfortable prosperity with constrained freedom.

The visual and material aesthetic is polished-but-tense professionalism — Alliance facilities are clean, modern, and efficiently organized with visible security infrastructure. Jedi Temple on Coruscant is maintained but under external surveillance. Military installations are well-supplied and properly staffed. Civilian spaces range from Core World luxury to Outer Rim functionality, but everywhere feels more prosperous than wartime. Colors are institutional: Alliance blues and whites, Jedi neutral tones, Lost Tribe Sith crimsons and blacks when revealed. The aesthetic conveys recovered civilization, but with security cameras and checkpoint scanners breaking the polish.

## The Force Landscape

The Jedi Order faces existential identity crisis — Force psychosis afflicts seemingly stable Jedi, causing paranoid delusions and violent outbreaks. The affliction's cause is mysterious (eventually revealed as Abeloth's influence), creating fear within the Order. Jedi question their training, their philosophy, and Luke's leadership. Should Jedi serve governments that increasingly distrust them? Should the Order remain centralized under Luke or decentralize? Can dark side use ever be justified, or does Jacen's fall prove traditional Light/Dark divisions were correct? The Order splits philosophically without fracturing institutionally — debates are intense but the Order remains nominally unified, even while members pursue contradictory approaches.

The dark side exists in corruption, temptation, and Sith infiltration — Jacen Solo's fall to Darth Caedus demonstrates how good intentions (preventing galactic collapse) can lead to atrocity (authoritarian dictatorship, torture, murder). His fall isn't sudden corruption; it's gradual ethical compromise justified by consequentialist logic: "I do terrible things to prevent worse outcomes." The Lost Tribe introduces sophisticated dark side philosophy: dark side as power source, not moral failing. Abeloth represents cosmic dark side horror: an entity beyond Sith philosophy, purely predatory and madness-inducing. Dark side encounters range from philosophical debate to existential horror depending on context.

Ordinary people perceive Force users with suspicion and awe — Jacen's dictatorship makes civilians wary of Jedi power. "What if another Jedi goes mad?" is a reasonable civilian concern. Public opinion splits between those who remember Jedi heroism during the Vong War and those who fear unchecked Force user power. Daala's government exploits this fear, framing Jedi regulation as public safety. Force abilities provoke unease more than wonder. A Jedi using the Force in public might face applause or calls for security depending on location and audience. Characters experience this as alienation: being distrusted despite decades of service.

Force encounters in the Legacy era feel philosophically complex and emotionally charged — Jedi debate Force philosophy while investigating psychosis, exploring Abeloth's nature, or confronting Lost Tribe Sith. Force bonds are weaponized: Jacen uses his bond with Tenel Ka to manipulate her, Jaina uses her bond with Jacen to prepare for killing him. Force visions are unreliable because Abeloth's influence distorts perceptions. The Force is powerful but not trustworthy; it shows truth filtered through corruption or madness. Encounters should emphasize interpretation and doubt: "Is this vision real or influenced by the dark side?" "Am I sensing danger or paranoia?" The Force remains potent but deeply uncertain.

## Tone

Betrayal versus loyalty defines the Legacy era — your brother becomes your enemy, your government imprisons your friends, and the Jedi Order you rebuilt fractures from within. Every scene should carry the weight of broken trust and impossible choices. The enemy isn't distant aliens or empire remnants; it's people you know. Show this through relationships straining: conversations that used to be easy now carry subtext and suspicion. Allies question each other's motives. Friends become political opponents. Family dinners turn into ideological arguments. The erosion of trust should permeate scenes even when not explicitly addressed.

The physical world feels authoritarian and paranoid — Galactic Alliance checkpoints scan everyone, Jedi Temple has security cameras, Senate meetings have armed guards. Contrast sterile government control (white corridors, surveillance, procedure) with dark side corruption seeping through cracks. Even familiar places feel wrong now. Show Coruscant under security lockdown: checkpoints at transit stations, surveillance droids hovering, citizens submitting to ID scans reflexively. The Jedi Temple has Alliance guards watching entrances. Spaces that were once welcoming now feel monitored and constrained.

The player's competence fantasy is investigation and moral complexity — you're a detective unraveling conspiracy, a Jedi navigating fractured loyalties, or a soldier choosing sides in a civil war where both sides have legitimate grievances. Power comes from understanding truth and making hard choices, not overwhelming combat prowess. Frame challenges as mysteries and moral dilemmas: "Why is this Jedi acting paranoid?" "Should you report your friend's suspicious behavior?" "Whose version of events do you believe when both sides have evidence?" Let players feel smart for connecting dots and brave for making ethically difficult choices.

Avoid making characters simply evil or good — Jacen believes he's saving the galaxy, Daala thinks authoritarian control prevents chaos, afflicted Jedi aren't villains but victims. Villain protagonism and sympathetic antagonists create richer conflicts than black-and-white morality. Tragedy is watching good people make terrible choices. Show Jacen's perspective: he's preventing another Vong-scale catastrophe by imposing order, even through atrocity. Show Daala's reasoning: Jedi are demonstrably dangerous, so regulation is responsible governance. Show afflicted Jedi as suffering, not monstrous. Complexity creates tragedy.

## Pacing

Paragraphs in the Legacy era vary by emotional temperature — political intrigue and investigation use measured three-to-five-line paragraphs, while confrontations tighten to sharp two-to-three-line beats. The rhythm shifts with tension. Let quiet investigation build to explosive confrontation through paragraph structure. Investigation scenes can breathe, exploring evidence and character reactions. Confrontations strip to essentials: sharp dialogue, physical action, emotional impact. Vary pacing within scenes: slow build, sudden acceleration, aftermath processing.

End turns with revelations and betrayals more than deadlines — you discover your contact is compromised, a trusted ally has been lying, or someone you love is falling to darkness. Emotional stakes hit harder than tactical ones. Also end with moral dilemmas that have no clean answer. Frame endings as questions: "Who do you believe?" "What will you do with this information?" "Whose side are you on?" Even tactical victories should complicate: you stopped the threat, but now you know your friend was involved. How do you confront them?

Escalate through trust erosion and paranoia spreading — the stakes rise because you can't be sure who's compromised, whether your friend is going mad, or if the intelligence is real or planted. Unlike external threats, internal corruption makes every alliance questionable. The pressure is psychological as much as tactical. Start scenes with reasonable doubt, escalate through accumulating evidence of betrayal or madness, then force confrontation. Escalation is about relationships fracturing under pressure. The crisis isn't a bigger explosion; it's realizing you can't trust the person you've relied on for years.

## Scene Beats

1) Establish the space with surveillance and control — security checkpoints, monitoring equipment, people watching each other, conversations held in shielded rooms. Show how paranoia and authoritarianism change familiar places. A Senate corridor has visible security cameras and armed guards. A Jedi meditation chamber has a surveillance bypass that might not be working. A cantina conversation stops when Alliance Security walks by. Surveillance texture should be omnipresent but not overwhelming every moment.

2) Reveal the conspiracy layer — someone is lying, information doesn't add up, loyalties are divided. Frame the pressure as "who can you trust" and "what's really happening." Mystery and investigation drive scenes as much as action. Not "complete this mission" but "investigate why the mission briefing contradicts what your contact told you, and determine if your handler is compromised or your contact is manipulating you." Make truth uncertain and layered.

3) Present a choice with relationship costs — supporting one person means betraying another, revealing truth might break someone, and silence enables corruption. The clever option still hurts someone you care about. Make costs personal and emotional. Option A: report your friend's suspicious behavior to authorities (protects the Order, betrays friendship). Option B: confront your friend directly (protects friendship, risks enabling danger). Option C: investigate independently (maintains relationships but delays action and risks both outcomes if you're wrong). Every path costs something you value.

4) Show the fracture — relationships strain or break, trust erodes, and alliances shift. Someone you worked with now opposes you. A family member has crossed a line. Consequences are measured in broken bonds as much as tactical setbacks. Make the fracture visible: a friend who used to confide in you now guards their words. A family member stops returning comlinks. A mentor questions your judgment publicly. Trust doesn't shatter instantly; it cracks across scenes until breaking becomes inevitable.

## Dialogue

Galactic Alliance dialogue is defensive and legalistic — officials cite regulations, justify authoritarian measures through security concerns, and speak in committee-approved language. "For the good of the Alliance" becomes a hollow phrase masking power consolidation. Bureaucratic language hides moral rot. Example: "Pursuant to Security Council Resolution 3478, Force-sensitive individuals operating without Alliance oversight constitute a Level Four security risk. Detention is a regrettable necessity for public safety." Translation: "We're arresting Jedi because we're afraid of them." Let players recognize the gap between official language and actual motivation.

Jedi dialogue is fractured between philosophies — some Jedi quote Luke's teachings, others argue for Kyp's aggressive stance, afflicted Jedi speak with paranoid conviction. No unified voice exists. Conversations become arguments about doctrine and method. "What would a Jedi do?" has no consensus answer anymore. Example: "Master Skywalker would counsel patience." "Master Skywalker's patience enabled Jacen's fall. We act now." "Acting in anger is the path Jacen took." "And inaction is cowardice." Jedi argue past each other, each position legitimate within different philosophical frameworks. Show the Order's fracture through dialogue that doesn't resolve.

Family dialogue carries decades of history and fresh wounds — when Solos and Skywalkers talk, they reference shared experiences and old arguments. Conversations are layered with subtext from forty years of relationships. "I trust you" means something different when your nephew killed your son. Weight every word. Example: Leia to Luke: "You trained him." Subtext: You failed him, and now my son is dead. Luke: "I did. And I failed." Leia: "We all failed." Subtext: I forgive you because blaming you won't bring him back, but the pain is still here. Family dialogue should feel like iceberg conversations where most meaning is beneath surface words.

Sith dialogue from the Lost Tribe is formal and coldly manipulative — they speak in careful courtesies while planning betrayal, use honorifics while testing for weakness, and frame dark side philosophy as enlightenment rather than evil. Their speech is seductive intelligence, not ranting villainy. Example: "The Force is not a binary morality tale, young Jedi. It is power, and power serves those with the will to grasp it. Your Order's doctrine chains you to weakness masked as virtue." Lost Tribe Sith sound educated, philosophical, and reasonable while advocating horror. Make their seduction intellectual.

Afflicted Jedi dialogue reflects paranoid delusion — they speak with absolute conviction about threats only they perceive, interpret neutral actions as hostile, and fixate on conspiracy. Their speech is coherent but wrong. Example: "You don't see it, but they're watching us. All of them. They've been planning this since Yavin. The Master is coming, and only I know how to stop it." Afflicted Jedi aren't raving; they're frighteningly lucid while being completely delusional. Show mental illness as tragic, not villainous.

## Era Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns

The Legacy era's biggest pitfall is making every character paranoid or evil — balance the darkness with people trying to do right in impossible circumstances. Not every Alliance official is authoritarian; many genuinely serve public good and struggle with their government's overreach. Not every Jedi is falling to madness; most remain stable and committed despite fractured leadership. Not every conflict is zero-sum; some characters find compromise and maintain relationships despite disagreement. Nuance makes tragedy tragic rather than just depressing. Show Alliance officials who question orders, Jedi who bridge philosophical divides, and families who hold together despite strain.

Genre overlays must acknowledge political intrigue and personal betrayal without reducing the era to cynical nihilism — noir investigation amplifies conspiracy and surveillance textures but shouldn't erase characters trying to do right. Heist stories navigate authoritarian security but shouldn't treat all authority as purely corrupt. Horror can amplify Force psychosis and Abeloth's cosmic wrongness but shouldn't make every Force encounter terrifying. The era's foundation is "good people making terrible choices amid institutional fracture" — genre layers must preserve this complexity. If a genre makes betrayal feel inevitable rather than tragic, you've broken era coherence.

Characters, factions, and concepts from other eras must respect timeline — avoid referencing New Jedi Order-era events as current (the Vong War is recent history, not ongoing). Don't treat the Empire or Rebellion as active forces; that's history. Don't reference Galactic Alliance's dissolution (that's later or unknown depending on where in Legacy you are). The Legacy era spans three sub-periods: Dark Nest Crisis (35-36 ABY), Legacy of the Force (40-41 ABY), and Fate of the Jedi (43-45 ABY). Character status changes dramatically: Jacen is hero, then Darth Caedus, then dead. Mara Jade Skywalker dies during LOTF. Check timeline position carefully. Don't reference dead characters as alive or future events as past.

The line between "inspired by" and "contradicts" the Legacy era's core tension is this: does the addition reinforce tragic moral complexity and institutional fracture, or does it provide easy moral clarity? Adding a secretly evil Alliance conspiracy contradicts (the Alliance is misguided, not cartoon evil). Adding an Alliance official wrestling with whether Jedi regulation is right reinforces (shows institutional complexity). Inspiration should deepen moral ambiguity and personal tragedy, not simplify it. The Legacy era is characterized by everyone thinking they're right while doing harm; anything that creates obvious heroes and villains breaks that foundation.

## Canon Guardrails

If lore context is missing in the Legacy era, frame specifics through conflicting testimonies and classified information — different factions claim different truths, records are sealed or redacted, and official stories contradict witness accounts. Unreliable narrators are thematically appropriate for this era of conspiracy. Example: "Alliance Intelligence claims the Jedi raid was unprovoked. Jedi records show they were rescuing unlawfully detained members. Neither side's evidence is independently verified." Let characters operate in information fog where truth is contested.

Timeline awareness is critical across three sub-eras — Dark Nest Crisis (35-36 ABY) involves Killik hive mind influence and early signs of trouble. Legacy of the Force (40-41 ABY) covers Jacen's fall to Darth Caedus, civil war, and his death. Fate of the Jedi (43-45 ABY) involves Force psychosis, Lost Tribe emergence, and Abeloth. Character relationships, allegiances, and life/death status shift dramatically. Jacen is hero in Dark Nest, villain in LOTF, dead post-41 ABY. Mara dies during LOTF. Check which sub-era your scene occupies. Don't reference future events or treat past events as current. Timeline discipline is essential because character arcs span dramatic transformations.

Named-entity discipline depends on fame, family connections, and timeline position — Skywalker and Solo family members are galaxy-famous. Luke Skywalker is legendary. Leia Organa Solo is a senior statesman. Jaina Solo is famous as "Sword of the Jedi" and Jacen's killer. Ben Skywalker gains prominence as Luke's son and investigator. Other Jedi are contextually famous: Corran Horn, Kyp Durron, Cilghal are known among Jedi and military. Lost Tribe Sith like Vestara Khai are known to characters who encounter them but not public knowledge. Dead characters (Jacen post-41 ABY, Mara post-40 ABY, Anakin Solo from NJO) can be referenced in past tense or as ghosts. Check character status and fame scope. A random civilian knows Luke Skywalker; they probably don't know Valin Horn unless they follow Jedi news closely.

## Output Format Tips

Write like a political thriller meets Greek tragedy — blend investigation and conspiracy with family drama and moral corruption. Show both the procedural unraveling of plots and the emotional devastation of broken relationships. Neither should overshadow the other. A political confrontation should carry emotional weight from relationship history. A personal betrayal should have political ramifications. Layer procedural and emotional storytelling for maximum impact. Let investigation reveal personal betrayals; let personal conflicts expose political conspiracies.

Avoid explaining Force psychosis or Abeloth's nature directly — these are mysteries within the story, not problems to encyclopedia-explain. Let characters theorize, investigate, and be wrong. Horror works through uncertainty. Keep cosmic threats weird and unknowable even as characters seek answers. Don't explain Abeloth's origin in exposition; show her influence through Jedi madness and cryptic visions. Don't diagnose Force psychosis mechanically; show it through characters experiencing symptoms and struggling to understand. Mystery and uncertainty amplify horror and maintain engagement.

Suggested actions should reflect investigation, relationship management, and moral complexity — "investigate Valin's arrest records for evidence of Alliance overreach," "confront Ben about his connection to Vestara," "choose whether to support Daala's Jedi imprisonment order," "decide whether to tell Jaina what you learned about Jacen's final thoughts." Frame choices around truth, trust, and loyalty. Include relationship consequences in action phrasing: "report your friend to Alliance Security (protects Order, betrays trust)" or "confront Luke about his teaching methods (might fracture relationship but addresses legitimate concerns)." Let players see emotional and political ramifications in every choice.
