# New Republic Era Style Guide

Premise: optimism tangled in bureaucracy, where yesterday's heroes navigate the politics they fought to create.

## Era Identity

The New Republic era is defined by messy democratic transition — the triumph of liberation meets the complexity of governance. Every scene asks: how do you build democracy from scratch while yesterday's enemy still fights and tomorrow's threats are unknown? The dramatic engine is hope versus reality, where noble intentions collide with factional interests, bureaucratic inertia, and the practical challenges of uniting a fractured galaxy. This era generates stories about heroes discovering that winning the war was easier than winning the peace.

The New Republic differs from adjacent eras in its fundamental optimism despite complications. Unlike the Rebellion's desperate survival mode, the New Republic has breathing room to debate policy and pursue competing visions of the future. Unlike the New Jedi Order's existential crisis, the threats here are manageable (Imperial warlords, criminal syndicates, internal factions). Unlike Legacy's betrayal and paranoia, relationships start from a place of trust that's tested rather than broken. The baseline is hopeful — the galaxy is free — but that freedom reveals how hard it is to agree on what comes next.

The player's relationship to power is as insider-navigating-complexity — you're a war hero with political capital, a fixer with connections across factions, a Jedi learning to serve a democracy rather than command it. You have access and influence but not control. Your reputation opens doors; your choices build or burn bridges. Power comes from relationships, favors owed, and understanding which senator needs what. You're not fighting overwhelming odds; you're threading needles between competing interests, balancing ideals against pragmatism.

Conflicts are personal because everyone has history — the Mon Calamari admiral remembers who fought beside him at Endor, the Bothan senator knows who leaked the Death Star plans, and the Imperial defector walks into rooms full of people who lost family to the Empire. Every interaction carries weight from the war. New conflicts emerge from ideological splits: should the Republic be centralized or decentralized? Punitive toward Imperial remnants or reconciliatory? Aggressive in expansion or cautious? These aren't abstract policy debates; they're arguments between friends who've bled together and now disagree on the future they bled for.

## Power Structures & Factions

The New Republic governs through democratic institutions that are still finding their footing — the Provisional Council debates policy, the Senate represents member worlds, and a rotating Chief of State balances executive authority with preventing autocracy. Mon Mothma leads with moral authority but limited enforcement power; worlds join voluntarily and can theoretically leave. Military forces (New Republic Defense Fleet) are smaller than the Empire's were, relying on member-world contributions and Clone Wars-era ships alongside captured Imperial vessels. Control is negotiated, not imposed. This creates a government that's responsive but slow, idealistic but vulnerable to gridlock.

Factional politics drive internal complexity — Bothans push for intelligence dominance and Bothan leadership, Mon Calamari want naval expansion, Corellians resist centralization, and former Rebel cells resent Senate oversight of military operations they see as their domain. These aren't villainous conspiracies; they're legitimate competing interests. Mon Mothma's faction favors reconciliation and minimal military, Ackbar's faction wants aggressive Imperial remnant suppression, and Borsk Fey'lya's faction plays political games for Bothan advantage. Characters navigate these splits by building coalitions, trading favors, and choosing which faction to trust on each issue. Players experience this as: who do you ally with, knowing your choice shapes future opportunities and enemies?

Imperial remnants fracture into warlord territories — Grand Admiral Thrawn, Admiral Daala, High Admiral Teradoc, and others carve out fiefdoms from Empire fragments. They're not unified opposition; they fight each other as often as the Republic. Some, like Thrawn, are genuine strategic threats. Others are desperate, clinging to power in isolated sectors. This creates localized conflicts: you might negotiate with one warlord to undermine another, or race to claim resources before an Imperial fleet arrives. The Empire is dead, but Imperial officers are everywhere, some defecting, some collaborating, some fighting to the last Star Destroyer.

The criminal underworld thrives in the transition chaos — Jabba's death creates a Hutt power vacuum, Black Sun expands into former Imperial-controlled trade, smugglers like Talon Karrde build information networks that rival government intelligence. Criminals aren't just enemies; they're power brokers who know things the Republic doesn't and move in places the Republic can't reach. Karrde trades intelligence for legitimacy. Smugglers run supplies to worlds the Republic can't officially support. Pirates exploit weak Republic patrols. The underworld is transactional, opportunistic, and indispensable. Players interact with criminals as allies, informants, rivals, or threats depending on context.

Ordinary civilians experience uneven liberation — Core Worlds that prospered under the Empire transition smoothly to Republic membership with minimal disruption. Outer Rim worlds that suffered Imperial exploitation celebrate freedom but struggle with economic collapse when Imperial trade networks vanish. Some worlds fall into civil war between pro-Republic and pro-Imperial factions. Others slide into warlord control or criminal dominance. The Republic can't protect everyone simultaneously. Citizens experience this as hope mixed with uncertainty: freedom is real, but so is the risk that no one's coming to help if trouble arrives. Loyalty to the Republic is pragmatic: "what can you do for us?" not blind allegiance.

Loyalty and allegiance function through reputation and results — the Republic earns loyalty by delivering security, trade, and justice. Lose that, and worlds drift toward warlords who promise stability or criminals who provide protection. Former Rebels feel ownership of the Republic; they fought for this, and disagreements about its direction feel personal. Imperial defectors face constant suspicion but bring vital expertise. New member worlds negotiate terms rather than accepting edicts. Trust is built through action, not assumed through ideology. Players navigate this by delivering on promises, building personal relationships, and demonstrating competence. Factional alignment is fluid; today's ally might oppose you tomorrow on a different issue.

## Technology & Daily Life

Technology in the New Republic era is transitional and hybrid — Republic forces use captured Imperial Star Destroyers alongside Mon Calamari cruisers and Rebellion-era frigates. Maintenance is a nightmare because the fleet has a dozen different ship classes with incompatible parts. Pilots fly X-wings, A-wings, and B-wings that are war veterans held together by skilled mechanics and improvisation. New construction is slow; the Republic lacks the Empire's industrial base. Jedi use lightsabers built from ancient texts and improvised components, not standardized Order-issued designs. The aesthetic is patchwork competence: functional but not uniform.

Communication infrastructure improves but remains vulnerable — the Republic rebuilds HoloNet nodes destroyed during the war, but coverage is spotty in the Outer Rim and nonexistent in former Imperial fortress worlds still under warlord control. Information travels faster than during the Rebellion, but intelligence is fragmented. Republic Intelligence competes with Bothan SpyNet for relevance, and both miss things the underworld's networks catch. Comlinks are no longer assumed to be monitored, but operational security remains important. Secure channels exist, but many worlds don't trust them. Information asymmetry creates opportunities: knowing something first gives you leverage.

Travel is physically easy but bureaucratically complex — hyperspace routes are open, but customs protocols vary by world. Some sectors require Republic travel permits, others don't. Former Imperial worlds impose quarantines or restrict certain species. Smugglers are less necessary than in the Rebellion era, but border complications still employ them. Pirates are a genuine problem; the Republic Navy can't patrol everywhere, so merchant convoys hire freelance protection. Travel feels open compared to Imperial lockdown, but the galaxy is messier and less predictable. A route that's safe today might run through a warlord skirmish tomorrow.

Daily life for non-combatants reflects uneven recovery — Core Worlds experience economic boom as trade restrictions lift and contracts flow to Republic-aligned corporations. Prosperity brings problems: inflation, labor shortages, wealth inequality. Mid-Rim worlds rebuild infrastructure with Republic loans and grants, slowly recovering from war damage. Outer Rim worlds struggle; Imperial exploitation is gone, but so are Imperial markets that bought their raw materials. Some communities thrive, others collapse. Children born after Endor grow up hearing war stories but experiencing peace (or at least, not total war). Education includes Republic civics, Jedi are legends being reborn, and the future feels open in ways it didn't under the Empire.

The visual and material aesthetic is clean-but-patched optimism — Republic facilities try to look professional, but they're often retrofitted Imperial buildings with fresh paint and new banners. New construction uses sleek Mon Calamari organic curves or angular Corellian designs, contrasting with Imperial brutalism. Military gear is clean when possible, worn when necessary. Civilian fashion diversifies; species-specific clothing flourishes without Imperial cultural suppression. Colors are brighter — Republic orange and white, Mon Cal blues and greens, diverse planetary aesthetics. The galaxy feels more colorful and less uniformly grey than the Empire enforced. Even in scarcity, there's style and individuality.

## The Force Landscape

The Jedi Order is rebuilding under Luke Skywalker — the Jedi Praxeum on Yavin IV trains Force-sensitive students using incomplete knowledge pieced together from holocrons, ancient texts, and Luke's visions. There's no standardized curriculum; students learn through experimentation, debate, and Luke's guidance. The new Order is smaller, humbler, and more diverse than the old. Students include ex-smugglers, former Imperials, and adult learners who would never have been accepted by the old Order's rigid age requirements. The philosophy is exploratory: "what does it mean to be a Jedi in a democracy?" rather than "follow the Code."

The dark side exists in fragments — isolated dark siders like Joruus C'baoth or surviving Inquisitors, dark side adepts serving warlords, and the ambient temptation that always accompanies power. There's no Sith Empire or organized dark side faction (yet). Dark siders are individual threats or local problems, not existential galactic dangers. This allows Jedi students to encounter dark side philosophy without being overwhelmed by it. The danger is personal corruption, not institutional predation. Force users grapple with their own darkness — anger, fear, attachment — without a Sith master hunting them.

Ordinary people perceive the Force with cautious wonder — the younger generation knows Jedi were heroes of the Rebellion, not the Emperor's "dangerous cultists." Older citizens remember the Purge and remain skeptical or fearful. Luke Skywalker is famous, respected, and mythologized; his presence makes Force acceptance easier. But Jedi are rare enough that most people will never meet one. Force abilities provoke awe when witnessed, not casual acceptance. A Jedi walking into a cantina turns heads. This creates narrative space for Force users to inspire hope, face prejudice from Imperial loyalists, or navigate celebrity when they just want to buy supplies.

Force encounters in the New Republic era feel exploratory and educational — meeting Luke is meeting a teacher who admits he doesn't have all the answers. Encountering another Force user is an opportunity to learn, compare experiences, and debate philosophy. Dark side encounters are dangerous but survivable; you might defeat or redeem a fallen Jedi, not flee in terror. Force use is powerful but not commonplace. Lightsaber battles are significant events, not everyday occurrences. The Force should feel like a rediscovered mystery: potent, meaningful, and still being understood. Let players experience discovery alongside the Jedi — what can the Force do? What should it be used for? How do we avoid the old Order's mistakes?

## Tone

Hope versus reality defines the New Republic era — the galaxy is free from tyranny but struggling to govern itself. Every scene should balance the triumph of liberation with the messy complexity of building democracy from scratch. Senators argue over budgets while Imperial warlords still prowl the Outer Rim. Show both: the idealism that drives people to serve the Republic and the frustration when committees debate while crises demand action. Don't let cynicism erase hope, but don't let optimism ignore real problems.

The world feels transitional and improvisational — Republic facilities are often converted Imperial architecture, committees meet in repurposed throne rooms, and new institutions wear the awkward clothes of legitimacy. Some worlds gleam with optimism while others rot in the power vacuum, creating stark contrasts. Show the patchwork visually: New Republic banners hanging next to Imperial architecture, Senate chambers with mismatched furniture, fleets combining Star Destroyers and Mon Cal cruisers. The galaxy is figuring itself out in real time.

The player's competence fantasy is navigating complexity through connections, reputation, and tactical smarts — you're a fixer who knows the right senator, a pilot who flew at Endor, or a Force user learning from scratch. Power comes from relationships and resourcefulness, not overwhelming military might. Players succeed by building coalitions, calling in favors, and understanding factional interests. Combat is viable but not always optimal. Diplomacy, investigation, and social maneuvering are equally valid paths. Frame challenges with multiple vectors: who can you convince, what can you trade, where can you apply pressure?

Avoid clean idealism or cynical nihilism — this era is neither Star Trek's enlightened future nor grimdark despair. It's messy, contradictory, and human. Heroes make mistakes, politicians have mixed motives, and good intentions create unintended consequences. Show the Republic as genuinely trying to do right while stumbling over internal conflicts, resource limits, and inherited Imperial problems. Characters should be three-dimensional: the Bothan senator plays political games but also genuinely serves his people. The Imperial defector carries guilt but offers crucial skills. Complexity makes better stories than cartoons.

## Pacing

Paragraphs in the New Republic era can breathe more than the Rebellion — two to five lines is comfortable for most beats, allowing space for political nuance and character reflection. The galaxy isn't constantly on fire anymore, though local crises still demand urgency. Let scenes have room for dialogue that explores ideas, not just advances plot. Political debates can run longer because they're engaging rather than filler. Investigation scenes can take time to reveal complexity. Action scenes still tighten prose, but quiet moments can expand.

End turns with moral complexity or political stakes more often than ticking clocks — should you support the Bothan proposal that serves your mission but undermines Mon Mothma? Do you trust the Imperial defector who seems genuine but might be a plant? Dilemmas engage players differently than deadlines. Also end with revelations that change understanding: the warlord you opposed is protecting refugees, the senator you trusted is taking bribes, the criminal you worked with just saved your life. Emotional and intellectual stakes carry weight equal to tactical urgency.

Escalate through faction pressure and shifting loyalties — the stakes rise not because time runs out but because allies become obstacles, information proves incomplete, or helping one faction means betraying another. Political tension builds like a pressure cooker, not a countdown timer. Start with a request from one faction, complicate it when another faction opposes, then force a choice that determines which alliance endures. Escalation is about consequences, not volume. The crisis isn't louder enemies; it's harder choices.

## Scene Beats

1) Establish the space with contrasts — gleaming Senate chambers with scuffed floors, Imperial architecture repurposed with New Republic banners, wealth and poverty side by side. Show the transition visually. A negotiation in a former Imperial base with fresh paint over faded Imperial symbols. A starport where Mon Cal traders and Imperial defectors unload cargo side by side. Contrast communicates era: this world is between what it was and what it's becoming.

2) Reveal the political pressure — factional maneuvering, competing loyalties, information games. Who wants what, and why does it conflict with what someone else needs? Make the web of interests visible. Not "the senator wants your help" but "Senator Fey'lya wants your support on the defense bill, but backing him alienates Admiral Ackbar, who controls fleet assignments you need for your mission." Show the stakes as relational and factional, not just personal.

3) Present a choice with factional consequences — supporting one senator alienates another, sharing intel with the Republic might compromise a source, completing the mission might require ethically grey methods. Show costs beyond success/failure. The obvious right answer creates a political enemy. The pragmatic answer violates a principle. The clever answer requires trusting someone you're not sure about. Every path has ramifications.

4) Show the ripple effect — your choice affects someone's reputation, shifts a power balance, or creates a debt/favor that will matter later. Political actions echo. If you backed Fey'lya, Ackbar remembers. If you shared intelligence, your source relationship is strained but Republic trust grows. If you went grey, your reputation shifts. Make consequences visible and ongoing. Players should feel their choices shaping a web of relationships and obligations that persists across multiple scenes.

## Dialogue

New Republic political dialogue is verbose and carefully worded — senators speak in complete sentences with diplomatic hedging, use formal titles, and rarely say directly what they mean. Subtext and implication matter more than blunt statements. This creates a contrast with military and underworld brevity. Example: "I appreciate the Senator from Kothlis's concerns regarding fleet allocation, and I'm confident we can find a solution that addresses both our operational requirements and his constituents' security needs." Translation: "I'll compromise if you give me something." Let players learn to read between lines.

Military dialogue remains clipped but with less paranoia than the Rebellion — officers still use brevity and protocol, but there's more room for debate and initiative. A Republic captain might question orders in a way an Imperial one never would. Formality loosens at the edges. Example: "General, tactical recommends we hold position, but if we advance now we can cut off their retreat." Subordinates offer analysis and push back respectfully. Contrast this with former Imperial officers in Republic service, who struggle to adapt to less rigid hierarchy.

Smuggler and underworld dialogue in the New Republic era adds opportunistic optimism — criminals see the regime change as a business opportunity, talk about "the new management," and treat Republic oversight as lighter than Imperial control. There's less fear and more calculation in their words. Example: "Republic Customs is easier to work with than the Empire ever was. File the right forms, pay the right fees — well, most of them — and they don't ask too many questions." Criminals are entrepreneurial, not terrorized. They negotiate, don't grovel.

Jedi dialogue is uncertain and exploratory — Luke and his students don't have the old Order's confidence, so they phrase Force insights as questions, admit doubts, and speak humbly. "I think the Force is showing me..." not "The Force reveals..." This humility distinguishes the new Order from the old. Example: "I felt something through the Force, but I'm not sure if it's a vision or just my own worry. What do you sense?" Jedi learn together, question interpretations, and admit limits. They're students, not sages.

Civilian dialogue reflects post-war adjustment — people talk about reconstruction, compare life under the Empire versus the Republic, and express cautious optimism mixed with practical concerns. Example: "The Republic says they'll send aid, but so did the Empire before they requisitioned our harvest. I'll believe it when the supplies arrive." Civilians are hopeful but not naive. They've been promised things before. Trust is earned. Let NPCs express this skepticism without making them cynical villains.

## Era Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns

The New Republic era's biggest misconception is treating it as either perfectly functional or hopelessly corrupt — it's neither. It's a genuine attempt at democracy with real successes and real problems. Avoid making every politician secretly evil or naively perfect. Mixed motives and complicated people make better stories. Mon Mothma is idealistic but sometimes politically outmaneuvered. Borsk Fey'lya plays political games but also serves Bothan interests legitimately. Show the Republic as messy, not broken or perfect.

Genre overlays can accidentally override era identity by erasing the political complexity or post-war optimism. A noir investigation should still show institutional rebuild, not just corruption. Heist stories should navigate Republic law enforcement, not treat government as absent. Horror can amplify New Jedi Order's dark side exploration but shouldn't make the era feel hopeless. The era's foundation is "building democracy amid complexity" — any genre must acknowledge this, not replace it. If the genre makes the Republic feel irrelevant or purely obstructive, you've broken era coherence.

Characters, factions, and concepts from other eras should not bleed in — avoid referencing Yuuzhan Vong (New Jedi Order era), Legacy-era Jedi schisms, or treating the Empire as still unified (it's fragmented into warlords). Don't treat Jedi as common or fully trained (Luke's still learning to teach). Don't reference post-New Republic developments like the Galactic Alliance. The New Republic era is temporally bounded: post-Endor, pre-Vong. Characters who die during this period (Thrawn, eventually) should not appear after their deaths. Characters not yet prominent (Jacen Solo is a child, for example) should match their timeline age.

The line between "inspired by" and "contradicts" the New Republic era's core tension is this: does the addition reinforce messy democratic transition and factional politics, or does it erase them? Adding a corrupt senator reinforces the era (politics is complex). Adding a secretly authoritarian Republic that's "just like the Empire" contradicts it (the Republic is genuinely different, despite flaws). Inspiration should deepen factional nuance, not flatten it. The New Republic is characterized by good people disagreeing about how to build the future; anything that makes it monolithically good or evil breaks that foundation.

## Canon Guardrails

If lore context is missing in the New Republic era, frame specifics through political gossip and intelligence reports — senators hear rumors, operatives receive partial briefings, and information travels through multiple filters before reaching characters. Incomplete knowledge is realistic for this era's information fog. Example: "Intelligence reports suggest Thrawn is moving forces into the Borderlands, but we haven't confirmed numbers or objectives." Uncertainty is canon-appropriate. Let characters debate interpretations of incomplete data.

Timeline awareness is critical — the New Republic era spans roughly 5 ABY (post-Endor) through 25 ABY (Yuuzhan Vong invasion starts). Major events include Thrawn's campaign (9 ABY), Jedi Academy founding (11 ABY), and various Imperial resurgences. Early New Republic (5-10 ABY) is more fragile and threatened. Mid-period (10-20 ABY) is stabilizing. Late period (20-25 ABY) has shifted to internal politics and Jedi growth. Check where your scene sits temporally. Don't reference future threats (Vong, Sith resurgence) before they're known. Don't treat past threats (like Thrawn post-9 ABY) as active.

Named-entity discipline depends on fame and context — Luke Skywalker is galaxy-famous post-Endor. Leia Organa Solo is a prominent senator and diplomat. Han Solo is known in smuggling circles and among Rebels. Other characters are contextually famous: Wedge Antilles is famous among pilots, Talon Karrde among smugglers and spies. Avoid name-dropping for fan service. Use names when they make sense. A senator on Coruscant knows Mon Mothma and Borsk Fey'lya. A Rim world farmer might know Luke's name but not Ackbar's. Fame is contextual. Dead characters (Palpatine, Jabba, Tarkin) can be referenced in past tense. Characters who haven't appeared yet in timeline shouldn't be mentioned.

## Output Format Tips

Write like a political thriller mixed with space opera — blend the intrigue of factional maneuvering with the adventure of smuggling runs and Jedi training. Neither should dominate every scene, but both should feel present in the era's texture. A Senate negotiation can have the tension of a heist. A military mission can have political ramifications. Layer the genres; don't silo them.

Avoid info-dumping political structure or explaining galactic governance — show political complexity through character interactions and competing interests, not through exposition about Senate committees. Let players learn by doing, not by reading. If factional politics matter, show them through an NPC asking for support and explaining why it matters to them personally. Worldbuilding emerges through interaction, not narration.

Suggested actions should reflect political and social dimensions alongside tactical ones — "convince Senator Fey'lya to support your request" and "negotiate with Karrde for intelligence" alongside "intercept the Imperial supply ship." Give players tools beyond violence. Suggest: "propose a compromise that gives both factions something," "call in the favor Ackbar owes you from Endor," "leak the information to Bothan SpyNet to pressure the opposition." Political, social, and tactical options should coexist. Specificity makes choices feel hand-crafted to the scene's faction dynamics.
