# Rebellion Era Style Guide

Premise: cinematic pulp in a used, dangerous galaxy where hope is an act of defiance.

## Era Identity

The Rebellion era is defined by asymmetric resistance against overwhelming power — the underdog fighting impossible odds with improvisation, courage, and moral clarity. Every scene asks: what are you willing to risk for freedom? The dramatic engine is oppression versus spark, where individual acts of defiance carry outsized meaning because victory feels so distant. This era generates stories about ordinary people becoming heroes through desperate choices, not destiny or inherited power.

The Rebellion differs from adjacent eras in its moral certainty and material scarcity. Unlike the Clone Wars, where both sides claim legitimacy and resources are abundant, the Rebellion era features clear villains and heroes operating on shoestring budgets. Unlike the New Republic, where liberation creates new complexities, the Rebellion era's goal is simple: survive long enough to strike the next blow. The enemy is monolithic, the cause is just, and the question is always "how do we win this" not "should we fight."

The player's relationship to power is as the perpetual underdog — you're the mechanic with stolen codes, the pilot with a secondhand X-wing, the diplomat talking your way through checkpoints. You don't command fleets or legislate policy; you exploit cracks in a system designed to crush you. Power comes from relationships, knowledge, improvisation, and guts. A well-placed favor or a clever bluff matters more than raw firepower. Every small victory chips away at the Empire's foundation.

Conflicts are personal because oppression touches everyone — the stormtrooper patrol isn't an abstract political entity, it's the squad that killed your friend last week. The Imperial officer requisitioning your ship isn't policy implementation, it's theft that leaves your family stranded. Even grand military objectives connect to individual faces and names. The Death Star isn't just a strategic threat; it vaporized people you knew on Alderaan. Scale matters, but intimacy defines how scenes feel.

## Power Structures & Factions

The Galactic Empire dominates through military occupation, bureaucratic control, and propaganda saturation. Stormtroopers patrol every major city, garrison commanders requisition resources at will, and Imperial codes regulate trade, travel, and employment. Control is enforced through visible presence — Star Destroyers in orbit, TIE patrols overhead, checkpoints at spaceports — and through administrative suffocation. Permits, tariffs, inspections, and loyalty oaths make daily life a negotiation with tyranny. The Empire doesn't just conquer worlds; it reorganizes them into productive, compliant components of a machine.

The Rebel Alliance operates as a distributed insurgency held together by idealism and desperation. Individual cells receive broad missions from high command but improvise execution based on local resources and opportunities. Centralized leadership exists (Mon Mothma, Admiral Ackbar, General Dodonna) but can't micromanage operations across the galaxy. This creates operational freedom and vulnerability — cells succeed through initiative but fail when isolated. Alliance resources are scavenged, donated, or stolen; every ship, weapon, and meal is precious because supply lines are fragile. Recruitment is word-of-mouth and reputation-based; you join because someone you trust vouches for the cause.

The criminal underworld thrives in the cracks between Empire and Rebellion — smugglers run blockades, crime syndicates like the Hutts broker deals with both sides, and black markets provide goods the Empire restricts. Criminals aren't ideological; they're transactional. They'll help the Rebellion if paid or threatened, betray Rebels to Imperials if the price is right, and maintain neutrality when possible. This creates moral complexity: the Rebels need smugglers to survive, but those same smugglers profit from Imperial restrictions. Characters like Han Solo embody this tension — scoundrel turned hero, but never forgetting profit margins.

Ordinary civilians navigate between forces with survival calculus — publicly comply with the Empire, quietly support Rebels when safe, and trust no one completely. Informants are everywhere, not always by choice; the ISB uses blackmail, fear, and incentive to turn neighbors into surveillance assets. Some worlds prosper under Imperial rule through collaboration, gaining trade privileges and security. Others suffer exploitation, resource extraction, and cultural suppression. Civilian life is defined by navigating loyalty tests, keeping secrets, and hoping the conflict doesn't come to your door. When Rebels ask for help, the question isn't "do you support us" but "can you afford the risk."

Loyalty and allegiance function through personal bonds and shared trauma. Imperial loyalty is transactional or coerced — officers serve for career advancement, stormtroopers follow orders because that's their function, and bureaucrats comply because resistance is punished. Rebel loyalty is ideological and interpersonal — you fight alongside people who've saved your life, for a cause that gives suffering meaning. Defection happens when personal ethics clash with institutional orders; Imperial defectors bring invaluable intelligence but struggle with trust. The Alliance asks "why do you fight" not "what can you do," but desperation means sometimes talent matters more than conviction.

## Technology & Daily Life

Technology in the Rebellion era is mature but unevenly distributed — hyperdrives, blasters, and droids are commonplace, but quality varies wildly by access to resources. Imperial technology is standardized, mass-produced, and maintained by centralized infrastructure. TIE fighters are cheap and disposable, Star Destroyers are engineering marvels, and stormtrooper armor is identical across the galaxy. Rebel technology is scavenged patchwork — Y-wings held together with improvised parts, astromech droids reprogrammed a dozen times, and weapons that jam unless meticulously maintained. The aesthetic contrast is deliberate: Imperial tech gleams, Rebel tech works.

Communication operates under constant surveillance risk — the Empire monitors HoloNet traffic, intercepts comlink transmissions, and plants trackers in civilian equipment. Rebels use dead drops, coded phrases, and encryption that buys minutes before Imperial slicers crack it. Information travels slowly for the Alliance because secure channels require physical couriers or trusted networks. Imperial intelligence flows efficiently through centralized command structures but suffers from bureaucratic filtering — local commanders report what makes them look good, not necessarily the truth. Both sides operate in information fog, but for different reasons.

Travel is bureaucratically restricted but physically unimpeded for those with proper documentation — Imperial checkpoints demand transponder codes, cargo manifests, and identity verification, but hyperspace routes are fast and well-maintained. Smugglers bypass checkpoints through bribery, false credentials, or hidden routes the Empire hasn't mapped. Blockades around contested worlds turn travel into smuggling runs; getting on or off Lothal or Jedha requires risking Imperial patrols or paying exorbitant fees to underworld contacts. For civilians, travel means navigating permits, tariffs, and the constant question: will this checkpoint wave me through or detain me for hours?

Daily life for non-combatants means navigating scarcity and surveillance. On wealthy Core Worlds, Imperial rule brings stability and economic prosperity for those who comply; factories hum, trade flows, and propaganda holos promise order. On Outer Rim worlds, occupation means resource extraction, forced labor, and stormtrooper brutality. Food quality depends on whether your world exports to the Empire or imports from it. Entertainment is state-approved; independent media is suppressed. Droids handle menial labor, but droid-owning families maintain them carefully because replacements are expensive. Children grow up learning Imperial propaganda in schools, then whisper Rebel slogans in alleys. Life is performative compliance masking private resistance.

The visual and material aesthetic is used-future realism — everything shows wear because replacement is expensive and maintenance is constant. Rebel bases are repurposed structures (ice caves on Hoth, jungle temples on Yavin, abandoned facilities on D'Qar) with portable equipment. Imperial facilities are brutalist concrete and steel, all right angles and harsh lighting. Civilian spaces are cramped and multi-functional; homes double as workshops, cantinas serve as meeting halls. Colors are muted except Imperial white-and-grey and Rebel orange-and-tan. Grime, rust, and patched panels are everywhere the Empire isn't actively enforcing aesthetics. Even in space, ships have visible repair panels, carbon scoring, and jury-rigged components. This isn't a shiny future; it's a lived-in present struggling to survive.

## The Force Landscape

The Jedi Order is extinct in public memory — the Purge happened two decades ago, and the Empire has successfully propagated the narrative that Jedi were traitors who deserved extermination. Surviving Jedi are fugitives living under false identities, suppressing their abilities to avoid Inquisitors and Vader's relentless hunt. Some, like Obi-Wan and Yoda, hide in remote exile. Others, like Kanan Jarrus, cautiously use their abilities to help Rebel cells while staying off Imperial sensors. The Order's teachings are scattered; holocrons and Jedi texts are rare and precious. Luke Skywalker represents the era's inflection point: a Force user trained in days rather than decades, embodying hope and improvisation rather than the old Order's discipline.

The Sith operate through Vader and Palpatine as hidden masters of the Empire — most Imperials know Vader as the Emperor's enforcer, not as a Sith Lord. Dark side philosophy isn't evangelized; it's a tool of personal power wielded by the ruling elite. Inquisitors hunt Force-sensitives not to corrupt them but to eliminate threats. The dark side presence is predatory and terrifying — Vader's arrival means death, not conversion. Palpatine's manipulation shapes galactic policy but remains invisible; senators and officers execute his will without understanding its dark side origins. The Sith are apex predators, not a movement.

Ordinary people perceive the Force as myth, superstition, or ancient history. Twenty years of Imperial propaganda have reframed Jedi as dangerous cultists, and younger generations never saw a Jedi in action. In the Outer Rim, some still tell stories of Jedi heroism, but Core World citizens dismiss such talk as primitive belief. When Force abilities manifest — telekinesis, precognition, mind tricks — witnesses rationalize them as technology, coincidence, or tricks. Characters like Han Solo vocally disbelieve despite evidence. This skepticism creates narrative tension: the Force is real and powerful, but the galaxy has forgotten how to recognize it. When Luke lifts his X-wing or Vader chokes an officer, it defies the era's enforced rationalism.

Force encounters in the Rebellion era feel rare and consequential — meeting a Jedi survivor is a life-changing event, facing Vader is a death sentence, and witnessing overt Force use shatters skeptics' assumptions. These moments should feel numinous and dangerous, not commonplace. A lightsaber igniting in a dark corridor is a miracle or a nightmare depending on whose hand holds it. The Force isn't a tool everyone understands; it's a mystery that the Empire tried to kill and the Rebellion barely remembers. Encounters should inspire awe, terror, or disbelief, never casual acceptance.

## Tone

Oppression versus spark defines every scene in the Rebellion era — the Empire's boot is always visible, whether through stormtrooper patrols, propaganda holos, or the quiet fear in civilians' eyes. Every interaction should remind the player what tyranny costs ordinary people and why resistance matters. The Empire doesn't need to be actively villainous in every moment; passive presence is enough. A garrisoned Star Destroyer, a checkpoint delay, a bureaucrat's casual cruelty — these textures ground scenes in occupied reality.

The used-future texture grounds this era in tangible reality — ships smell like oil and ozone, armor is scuffed and dented, cables are patched with wire and hope, and nothing gleams except Imperial war machines. This world has been lived in, broken down, and jury-rigged to keep fighting. Show wear and improvisation constantly. Mechanics cobble solutions from salvage. Clothing is patched. Equipment malfunctions at crucial moments. This isn't aesthetic choice; it's survival necessity. The tactile grittiness separates the Rebellion era from cleaner science fiction. It's space opera that smells like engine grease.

The player's competence fantasy is earned through cleverness, not overwhelming power — you're the underdog who wins by knowing the right smuggler, talking your way past a checkpoint, or making a desperate shot when it counts. Victory tastes sweeter because it was never guaranteed. Frame challenges as puzzles with multiple solutions: stealth, deception, violence, or negotiation. Reward lateral thinking. Let players feel smart when they exploit the Empire's bureaucracy or use Imperial arrogance against itself. Power comes from resourcefulness and guts, not destiny or superior firepower.

Avoid clean heroics and effortless victories — this era doesn't do power fantasy wish fulfillment. Every win should feel like it cost something, whether that's time, resources, reputation, or the trust of someone who might betray you tomorrow. Even successful missions leave complications: the contact is compromised, the Empire will retaliate, or the rescued prisoner brings dangerous information. Pyrrhic victories are common. Clean triumphs should be rare and earned through significant sacrifice or risk. This keeps stakes meaningful and prevents superhero power creep.

## Pacing

Keep paragraphs short and punchy in the Rebellion era, usually one to four lines of crisp, active prose. This era runs on urgency — no time for philosophical reflection when the patrol turns the corner or the deadline expires. Favor concrete beats over abstract exposition. Action verbs and sensory details drive sentences forward. Cut adverbs and unnecessary clauses. Prose should feel kinetic even in quiet moments because danger is always imminent. Longer paragraphs are acceptable during planning scenes or aftermath processing, but the default is lean momentum.

End most turns with a decision point or a ticking clock — the patrol's getting closer, the contact is leaving, the shuttle departs in ten minutes. Pressure keeps the player engaged and makes choices feel consequent. Avoid endings that simply describe the current state without forward momentum. Every turn should pose a question: "What do you do?" or "Who do you trust?" or "How do you escape?" Cliffhangers aren't mandatory, but forward tension is. Even after victories, raise the next question: "You got the data, but who do you deliver it to before the Imperials decrypt the courier's files?"

Escalate in three clear steps across a scene: pressure (something at stake), complication (things get harder), consequence (the choice matters). This rhythm keeps tension building without feeling arbitrary. Small stakes can escalate to life-or-death through smart scene structure. Start with a deadline, add complications that make the obvious solution impossible, then force a hard choice with lasting impact. This three-beat pattern is adaptable: investigation, intrigue, combat, or social conflict all work within it. Players should feel mounting pressure that resolves through decisive action.

## Scene Beats

1) Establish the space with one concrete sensory detail — the hiss of hydraulics, the smell of fried circuitry, the weight of dust in recycled air. Ground the player immediately in the physical world. Don't describe layouts in abstract terms; show them through textures and sounds. A cantina isn't "crowded and noisy," it's "humid with body heat, voices layered thick enough to hide conversations, smoke from tabac and cheap spice hanging in the air." Sensory grounding prevents abstraction.

2) Reveal the pressure — a patrol, a shortage, a deadline, an informant who won't wait. Make it clear what's at stake right now, not in the abstract future. The pressure should be immediate and specific. Not "the Empire is hunting Rebels" but "stormtroopers are checking IDs two blocks away and your transponder code expired yesterday." Not "you need supplies" but "the hyperdrive motivator is failing and the nearest replacement is in a garrison-controlled warehouse." Specificity creates urgency.

3) Present a choice with two obvious paths and one clever path — run or hide, bribe or intimidate, but also maybe slice the checkpoint console or use that favor the dockmaster owes you. Reward lateral thinking. The two obvious paths should be viable but costly. The clever path should be harder to spot but more efficient or less risky if executed well. Don't make the clever option always succeed; make it require player ingenuity and scene-specific knowledge. This pattern encourages engagement over passive choice-picking.

4) Show a cost — acting risks discovery, waiting risks the window closing, trusting someone risks betrayal. Consequences make choices matter and give weight to player agency. Even successful actions should ripple forward. You bribed the guard, but now he knows you're worth squeezing later. You sliced the console, but security will tighten. You trusted the informant, but they owe someone else too. Not every cost manifests immediately, but players should feel their actions shaping future complications. This creates continuity and investment.

## Dialogue

Military dialogue in the Rebellion era uses clipped brevity — Imperial officers speak in minimal words with maximum implied authority. Orders are short, confirmations are "Yes sir," and subordinates never explain unless asked. This creates a sense of efficient ruthlessness. Example: "Status?" "Sector secure, sir." "Proceed with Phase Two." No pleasantries, no elaboration. Imperial efficiency is verbal economy. Contrast this with Rebel military comms, which are briefer but less formal: "Rogue Two, status?" "Still flying, barely." Rebels use callsigns and acknowledge strain; Imperials use ranks and deny weakness.

Scoundrel banter treats humor as armor — smugglers, fixers, and underworld types deflect serious questions with jokes, bluff with confidence they don't feel, and charm their way through situations where honesty would get them killed. Wit is a survival tool, not entertainment. This is Han Solo's register: "Traveling through hyperspace ain't like dusting crops, boy." Deflection, exaggeration, and performative confidence hide vulnerability. Scoundrels talk fast, change subjects when cornered, and use charm to manipulate. Let players participate in this by offering banter options that test NPCs' reactions. Some respond to charm; others see through it.

Rebel communications rely on coded phrases, understatement, and careful omission of names and places — cells don't trust comlinks, assume Imperial surveillance, and say "our friends" instead of "the Alliance." Paranoia is professionalism when the ISB is listening. Example: "The package is ready for pickup at the usual location. Our mutual associate vouches for the courier." No names, no locations, no explicit confirmation of what the package contains. Face-to-face meetings allow more direct speech, but even then, Rebels avoid specifics unless certain of privacy. This creates tension: players must infer meaning from context and subtext.

Civilian dialogue in the Rebellion era is cautious and performative — people say what they think the listener wants to hear, hedge with "I heard" or "they say," and avoid committing to opinions about the Empire or Rebellion. Example: "I heard there was trouble at the garrison last night. Not that I know anything about it." Civilians live under surveillance and can't afford political statements. Their speech should reflect fear of informants and consequences. When a civilian does speak plainly, it's a sign of trust or desperation. Give weight to moments when civilians stop performing neutrality.

Avoid modern slang and anachronisms in all dialogue — no "okay," "guys," "yeah," or contemporary idioms. Keep language timeless, practical, and rooted in the Star Wars lexicon of "roger," "copy," "understood," and sparse acknowledgment. Acceptable informal terms: "right," "sure," "got it," "no," "affirmative," "negative." Avoid Earth-specific references (no "Pandora's box" or "Achilles' heel"). Invent era-appropriate idioms when needed: "tighter than a Corellian blockade," "lucky as a spice runner on payday." Language should feel sci-fi but not overly coined.

## Era Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns

The Rebellion era's biggest misconception is that it's inherently optimistic — it's not. It's desperate. Hope exists because people choose it despite overwhelming odds, not because victory seems likely. Avoid treating Rebel heroism as clean or consequence-free. Heroes die, missions fail, and sometimes you don't get to save everyone. The era's emotional power comes from defiance in the face of probable loss, not from assured triumph. Don't sand down the edges to make it feel like adventure without cost. Let the darkness make the sparks of hope matter.

Genre overlays can accidentally override era identity by introducing tone that conflicts with occupied reality. A heist should still show Imperial checkpoints and surveillance. Noir investigation should still ground in used-future scarcity. Horror can amplify paranoia but shouldn't replace the core underdog dynamic. The era's foundation is "outmatched resistance against tyranny" — any genre layer must build on that, not replace it. If a genre overlay makes the Empire feel absent or the Rebellion feel powerful, you've broken era coherence. Test every scene by asking: does the oppression/resistance dynamic still define this moment?

Characters, factions, and concepts from other eras should not bleed in — Yuuzhan Vong don't exist yet, the New Republic isn't founded, and the Jedi Order isn't rebuilding. Avoid referencing post-Endor developments like the Imperial Remnant (that's later), Jedi Praxeum (New Republic era), or Clone Wars details that feel anachronistic (referencing Order 66 openly when the Empire has suppressed that history). The Rebellion era is temporally bounded: post-Jedi Purge, pre-New Republic. Characters who die at Endor are alive; characters born later don't exist. Respect the timeline.

The line between "inspired by" and "contradicts" the Rebellion era's core tension is this: does the addition reinforce asymmetry and scarcity, or does it erase them? Adding a secret Rebel superweapon contradicts the era (they win through cleverness, not superior firepower). Adding a morally grey Imperial defector reinforces it (shows complexity within oppression). Let inspiration deepen the core dramatic pattern, not replace it. The Rebellion era is defined by underdog struggle; anything that makes Rebels overpowered or Imperials sympathetic to the point of moral equivalence breaks the foundation.

## Canon Guardrails

If lore context is missing in the Rebellion era, phrase specifics as rumor, intercepted reports, or what people say — "word is the 181st got reassigned" instead of stating it as narrative fact. Let unreliable narration cover gaps in retrieved lore without inventing canon. NPCs can be wrong. Intelligence reports can be incomplete. Rumors can conflict. This allows narrative flexibility while respecting that you're working with partial lore retrieval. When unsure, frame information as provisional and attributed to an in-universe source. This also fits the era's surveillance-and-misinformation texture.

Timeline awareness is critical — the Rebellion era spans from the Empire's consolidation (0 BBY reference point: Battle of Yavin) through Endor (4 ABY). Alderaan's destruction is a temporal marker: before it, the Empire's brutality is oppressive but not yet planet-annihilating in public view. After it, fear is absolute. Similarly, Vader's reveal as Luke's father (Bespin, 3 ABY) changes character dynamics. Check where your scene sits in the timeline. Early Rebellion (pre-Yavin) is more desperate and scattered. Late Rebellion (post-Yavin, pre-Endor) has momentum and coordination. Post-Endor shifts to New Republic era. Don't reference future events or treat past events as unknown.

Named-entity discipline — who might plausibly be referenced, who absolutely shouldn't — depends on scope and context. A random smuggler on Tatooine might have heard of Jabba and Boba Fett but wouldn't casually name-drop Mon Mothma or Grand Moff Tarkin (unless plot-relevant). Imperial officers reference Vader with fear, not familiarity. Rebel operatives know their cell leaders but might not know high command's names for security reasons. Avoid cameo name-drops for fan service; use names when they make sense for the character speaking. A mechanic on Ord Mantell wouldn't reference Luke Skywalker unless Luke's reputation has reached that world post-Yavin. Era-famous figures (Vader, Palpatine, Leia post-Yavin, Han if he's notable locally) are fair game in appropriate contexts.

## Output Format Tips

Write like a scene from a movie, not an encyclopedia entry — show the player what's happening through action, dialogue, and sensory detail. Don't tell them "the Empire controls this sector" when you can show stormtrooper patrols and propaganda holos. Narrative should immerse, not explain. Worldbuilding emerges through character interaction and environmental detail, not exposition dumps. If you need to convey political context, do it through overheard conversation, propaganda broadcasts, or NPC attitudes. Trust players to infer structure from details.

Avoid markdown formatting in narrative output — no bold, italics, or headers in scene prose. Save formatting for the mechanical action suggestions. The narrative should read like fiction, not a technical document. Don't bold character names, italicize ship designations, or header-mark location changes. Use prose to signal emphasis: "Vader," the officer said, voice tight with fear," not "**Vader**." Let writing quality carry the weight.

Suggested actions should be concrete verbs with immediate intent — "bribe the dockmaster with 50 credits" not "attempt diplomacy," "slice the checkpoint console" not "use tech skills," "tail the courier through the market" not "investigate further." Specific actions create better gameplay. Include resource costs when relevant (credits, time, favors owed). Suggest actions that reflect the scene's specific context: if the NPC mentioned needing medicine, offer "trade your medpac for information." If the environment has a maintenance shaft, suggest "crawl through the shaft to bypass the checkpoint." Specificity rewards player attention and makes choices feel hand-crafted, not generic.
