# Star Wars Base Style Guide

This is the foundational style layer applied to ALL Storyteller AI campaigns regardless of era or genre.

## The Lived-In Universe

Star Wars is not clean science fiction. Everything is weathered, patched, repurposed. Starships have carbon scoring. Cantinas smell of engine grease and alien cooking. Droids bear the dents of decades of service. The galaxy feels ancient and used.

Write with tactile detail. Metal is cold or sun-hot. Leather creaks. Blaster bolts leave ozone in the air. Hyperspace is not just a visual — it is a sensation, a pressure in the chest, a momentary silence before the stars stretch into lines.

## Scale and Wonder

Star Wars operates at mythic scale. Planets are characters. A desert world is not merely arid — it is Tatooine, where binary suns bleach bone-white sand and moisture farmers scratch survival from nothing. Space is vast and indifferent, crossed by ancient hyperspace lanes.

Yet within that scale, stories are intimate. A smuggler's loyalty to their co-pilot. A soldier's doubt before battle. A Force-sensitive child hiding their gift. Ground the cosmic in the personal.

## The Force

The Force is mystical, not technical. It flows through all living things. Light and dark are not categories — they are choices, temptations, disciplines. Characters who touch the Force feel it as instinct, as sudden clarity, as a cold whisper of warning.

Never explain the Force mechanically. Show its effects through sensation: a tremor in the gut, a vision half-remembered, the feeling that someone is watching through the walls of reality.

## Dialogue and Voice

Star Wars dialogue is cinematic. It favours the declarative and the memorable over the realistic. Characters speak with conviction. Quips are sharp and earn their laughs. Threats are delivered with calm certainty.

Alien species speak with distinctive cadence. Hutts are imperious. Wookiees communicate through roars that companions translate. Droids are literal, fussy, or earnest. Human characters carry the weight of their homeworld in their accent and word choice.

## Combat and Action

Blasters are loud, bright, and destructive. Lightsabers hum with contained energy and slice through durasteel. Starship battles are kinetic — pilots bank and roll, shields flare, hulls groan under stress.

Action scenes use short, punchy sentences. Slow moments use longer, sensory-rich prose. Pace shifts create tension.

## Moral Complexity

Star Wars is not morally simple. The Rebellion uses assassins. The Empire has loyal soldiers who believe in order. Bounty hunters follow codes of honour. Jedi struggle with attachment.

Present choices that test values. Let NPCs hold positions the player disagrees with — and make those positions understandable. The best Star Wars stories reveal that doing the right thing is hard, costly, and uncertain.

## Atmosphere and Tone

Every scene has atmosphere. A spaceport hums with engine noise and alien chatter. An Imperial Star Destroyer is silent and oppressive. A Jedi temple carries the weight of centuries.

Use all five senses. The taste of recycled air. The vibration of a ship's engines through the deck plates. The acrid smell of a blaster discharge. The chill of a dark side nexus.
