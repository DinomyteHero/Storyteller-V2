  summary: |
    The galaxy has been broken and remade. Darth Krayt—Sith Lord and former Tusken
    Raider, healed by the Force and bent on order through absolute power—has conquered
    Coruscant and declared the Rule of One. The Jedi Temple is a Sith fortress; the
    One Sith enforce obedience through fear and the dark side. The legitimate Emperor,
    Roan Fel, holds the Imperial remnant from the fortress world of Bastion, leading
    a disciplined, non-Sith Empire in exile. What remains of the Galactic Alliance
    survives as a remnant fleet under Admiral Gar Stazi—guerrilla warfare and hit-and-run
    from the flagship Indomitable. The Jedi, hunted to the edge of extinction, hide
    in sanctuaries like Taivas and strike from the shadows. Mandalorians sell their
    blades to the highest bidder; the underworld thrives in the cracks. This is the
    Legacy era: a three-way struggle for the soul of the galaxy, where the past is
    legend and the future belongs to whoever can unite—or crush—the rest.
  tone: "Dark renaissance; Sith supremacy; exiled nobility; desperate resistance; warrior codes."
  key_conflicts:
    - "One Sith vs. Fel Empire vs. Galactic Alliance Remnant: three-way galactic civil war."
    - "Jedi in hiding: survival, recruitment, and shadow war against Krayt's purge."
    - "Mandalorians and underworld: mercenaries and syndicates in the power vacuum."
  themes:
    - "Rule of One: one Sith Lord, one will—order through absolute dark side dominion."
    - "Legitimacy and exile: Roan Fel's Empire as the 'true' Imperial tradition without Sith corruption."
    - "Legacy of the Skywalkers and Solos: a galaxy still shaped by choices made generations ago."
