# ============================================================
# rumors.yaml -- Rumors (TEMPLATE)
# ============================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Information that NPCs can share with the player. Rumors serve as narrative
#   hooks, world-building flavor, and quest hints. The Director uses rumors
#   to drive NPC dialogue and reveal information gradually.
#
# USED BY:
#   - Director node: reads text and tags for NPC dialogue hooks
#   - NPC knowledge: rumor IDs are referenced by npcs.yaml knowledge.rumors
#
# CONVENTIONS:
#   - Rumor IDs use "rumor_" prefix with snake_case: rumor_hidden_cache
#   - Keep rumor text concise: 1-2 sentences
#   - Aim for 5+ rumors per era for variety
#   - Tag rumors by theme so the Director can match them to scene context
#
# GOTCHAS:
#   - Rumor IDs are referenced by NPCs via knowledge.rumors -- must match exactly
#   - scope: "global" (known everywhere) or "location" (only at specific places)
#   - credibility: "rumor" (unverified), "likely" (probably true), "confirmed" (verified)
#   - Always quote strings containing colons
