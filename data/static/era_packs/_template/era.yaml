# era.yaml -- Era Pack Manifest (TEMPLATE)
# ============================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Root manifest file for an era pack. Declares the era ID, schema version,
#   and indexes all other files. Also defines starting locations, global events,
#   travel graph, and display metadata.
#
# USED BY:
#   - Era pack loader (backend/app/world/era_pack_loader.py)
#   - Architect node (campaign setup — reads start_location_pool)
#   - Director & Narrator (reads metadata.tone, metadata.themes for prompt context)
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
#   1. Copy this entire _template/ directory to data/static/era_packs/<your_era_key>/
#   2. Replace "_TEMPLATE" with your era key (UPPERCASE convention: REBELLION, OLD_REPUBLIC, etc.)
#   3. Fill in metadata, then author the other files
#   4. Run the test suite to validate cross-references:
#      python -m pytest backend/tests/ -k "era_pack" -q --tb=short
#
# GOTCHAS:
#   - file_index keys MUST exactly match: era, locations, npcs, factions, backgrounds,
#     namebanks, quests, events, rumors, meters, facts, companions
#   - start_location_pool IDs MUST exist in locations.yaml
#   - era_id should be UPPERCASE by convention (e.g., REBELLION, OLD_REPUBLIC)
#   - style_ref path is relative to the project root
