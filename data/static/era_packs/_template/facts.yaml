# facts.yaml -- Knowledge Graph Seed Facts (TEMPLATE)
# ============================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Seed facts for the knowledge graph, expressed as subject-predicate-object
#   triples. These form the foundational knowledge that NPCs can reveal and
#   that the KG extractor uses to build the world model.
#
# USED BY:
#   - KG extractor (backend/app/rag/kg_retriever.py): seeds the knowledge graph
#   - NPC knowledge: fact IDs are referenced by npcs.yaml knowledge.secrets
#
# CONVENTIONS:
#   - Fact IDs use "fact_" prefix with snake_case: fact_alpha_controls_hub
#   - subject and object should reference valid entity IDs where possible
#     (faction IDs, NPC IDs, location IDs)
#   - predicate is a relationship verb: controls, hides_in, allied_with,
#     opposes, trades_with, hunts, protects, etc.
#   - confidence: 0.0 (uncertain) to 1.0 (absolute certainty)
#   - Aim for 2+ facts per era minimum
#
# GOTCHAS:
#   - Fact IDs are referenced by NPCs via knowledge.secrets -- must match exactly
#   - subject and object should reference valid entity IDs from other files
#   - confidence is optional; defaults vary by system
# ============================================================
