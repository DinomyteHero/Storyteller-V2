  summary: 'The galaxy lives under the boot of the Galactic Empire. The Emperor rules from the throne

    world of Coruscant; his enforcer, Darth Vader, hunts the last of the Jedi and crushes

    dissent. The Death Star has made rebellion unthinkable—until a band of rebels steal

    its plans and strike the first blow at Yavin. In the shadows, the Alliance to Restore

    the Republic runs a fragile network of cells: starfighter pilots, spies, and idealists

    who believe the Republic can rise again. Smugglers and crime lords thrive in the

    margins, selling to both sides. It is an age of hope and terror, of hidden bases and

    Imperial crackdowns, where one wrong move can burn a cell and one act of courage

    can change the fate of the galaxy.

    '
  tone: Gritty hope; underdog resistance; imperial oppression; found family; moral stakes.
  key_conflicts:
  - 'Alliance vs. Empire: asymmetric war, intelligence and morale as much as firepower.'
  - 'Jedi legacy vs. Imperial purge: the last guardians in hiding; the Force as secret and weapon.'
  - 'Outer Rim lawlessness: Hutts, smugglers, and bounty hunters in the Empire''s shadow.'
  themes:
  - Restoration of the Republic and freedom versus order through fear.
  - 'Sacrifice and compartmentalization: rebels who never know the full picture.'
  - 'Technology and myth: the Death Star as symbol of terror; the Force as forbidden hope.'
