  description: |
    The Alliance's secret headquarters hidden deep within the Great Temple—a Massassi ruin rising from the Yavin 4 jungle like a colossal stone fist. The temple's labyrinthine chambers have become the Rebellion's nerve center: a sprawling network of briefing rooms, fighter bays, communications relays, and barracks carved from ancient stone. The air is heavy with humidity and the constant hum of life support systems struggling against the jungle heat. Pilots conduct pre-flight briefings in the war room where holographic star charts glow like dying stars. The base is ruthlessly compartmentalized—pilots rarely know the intelligence officers, strategists avoid contact with demolition squads—a security measure born from the certainty that the Empire will eventually find them. Evacuation protocols hang over every decision: which assets to save, which to destroy, which fighters have been pre-positioned for escape. The jungle itself serves as shield and sentinel—thick vines strangle sensor nets, monsoon rains scramble probe droid trajectories, and the deafening chorus of Yavin's fauna masks the sound of Y-wing engines firing up. Yet for all its defenses, everyone in Yavin Base knows they're living on borrowed time. The Empire learns faster with each passing day.

    The Rebellion's beating heart—a cavernous chamber buried within the temple's upper tiers. Ancient Massassi carvings line the walls, depicting ritualistic scenes now overshadowed by flickering holo-displays and tactical maps. Mon Mothma and other Alliance High Command gather here to orchestrate the war: glowing star charts show Imperial positions, rebel supply routes twist across light-years, and red blinking icons mark the locations of fleet elements. The war room's silence is oppressive—only whispered coordination, the click of datapads, and the occasional sharp intake of breath as news arrives of another destroyed cell or captured operative. A hologram projector dominates the center of the chamber, casting shadows that make everyone look older, harder, haunted.

  description: |
    The roar of dying starfighter engines echoes off stone walls that have stood for millennia—now repurposed as a launch bay for X-wings and Y-wings. Maintenance crews swarm over sleek fighters, welding hull breaches, replacing scored canopies, loading torpedo magazines with the precision of a ritual. The air reeks of ozone, burnt metal, and the acrid stench of hyperdrive coolant. Red-painted technicians move with surgical precision, knowing that a misaligned wing strut or a faulty connector could kill a pilot tomorrow. Pilots loiter near their starfighters like anxious parents—some running through pre-flight checklists obsessively, others trying to catch sleep between sorties. The oldest ships bear the scars of three campaigns: blaster scoring, microfractures in the transparisteel, landing gear that no longer fully retracts. Yet they fly. And when they fly, they hurt the Empire.

    Bacta tanks glow with eerie blue light in the humid temple chamber, suspended in the darkness like alien wombs. The Rebellion's medical teams work in organized chaos—triage beds line the walls, emergency surgery kits stand ready, and the smell of bacta and antiseptic mingles with the wet jungle air leaking through cracks in the ancient stone. Medics patch up burned pilots, remove shrapnel from guerrilla fighters, and argue in hushed tones about which wounded to prioritize when bacta supplies run low. The bacta itself is precious beyond measure—every tank represents credits the Rebellion can't spare, smuggled past Imperial inspection. Some wounded recover; others are sent to safe houses to convalesce in hiding. The facility's unofficial motto: "Patch them fast and get them back in the fight—we can't afford to lose anyone."

    A frozen fortress carved into the ice cliffs of Hoth—Echo Base is the Rebellion's last stand on the edge of oblivion. The installation tunnels deep beneath the planet's surface, protected by layer upon layer of shielded corridors and blast doors. Above ground, the landscape is a white hell: howling winds that strip the flesh from unprotected faces, ice storms that blind probe droids' sensors, and the grinding silence of a world that has never known warmth. The shield generator crouches on the tundra like a predator, its energy dome flickering against the constant battering of Hoth's atmosphere. Inside, the base is a maze of ice-caves and durasteel corridors packed with fighters, transports, armor crews, and the walking ghosts of soldiers who know the Empire has found them. Ion cannons sit ready to claw at Star Destroyers. Snowspeeders are being fueled for dogfights they'll likely lose. General Rieekan coordinates the evacuation—which assets leave first, which troops hold the perimeter, which people die to buy time for the rest. The cold seeps through every wall. Everyone shivers.

    The frozen nerve center of Echo Base, buried three levels beneath the ice. Holographic displays cast a cold glow over tacticians and officers coordinating the base's defense against the Imperial assault. The ice-carved walls are reinforced with durasteel plating, and blast shields hang ready to seal the chamber if the outer defenses fail. A wall of screens shows sensor data—Star Destroyer positions slowly converging on the base, snowspeeder locations, shield generator status. The air is still and cold, preserved by advanced climate control struggling against Hoth's relentless freeze. Everyone knows this is a holding action. The question isn't whether the Imperials will break through—it's how many will survive evacuation.

    Rowdy engines and the metallic scrape of snowspeeder wings echo off the ice chamber walls.

The hangar is a study in controlled desperation: fuel lines freeze mid-drip, harpoon cables are coiled carefully to prevent brittleness, targeting computers struggle against electromagnetic interference from Hoth's magnetic fields. Luke Skywalker and other elite pilots gather here before each patrol, knowing that today might be the day they don't come back.

    Admiral Ackbar's Mon Calamari cruiser rises from the void like a living thing—all organic curves and hardened coral-durasteel, the flagship of the Rebel Alliance. At over 1,200 meters long, Home One serves as the mobile capital of the Rebellion, carrying the Supreme Commander and the fleet's strategic leadership. The bridge hums with constant activity as tactical officers coordinate starfighter wings and strike groups across entire sectors. Corridors branch into officer quarters, tactical briefing rooms, and communications relays that reach across the galaxy—each message encrypted, each transmission risking discovery. The ship itself is a statement of defiance: built not as a weapon of conquest but as a platform for hope, its medical bays packed with bacta tanks, its cargo holds stuffed with supplies for desperate resistance cells. The crew are hand-picked volunteers who know they ride the most hunted vessel in the galaxy—if the Empire finds Home One, they all die. Ackbar's quarters overlook the void of space, and his tactical maps show the slow contraction of the Rebellion's territory, the Empire's methodical choking of rebel supply lines, the clock counting down. Yet the Admiral remains composed, planning for tomorrow because the Rebellion cannot afford despair.

    The bridge of Home One is a cathedral of command—a vast, curved chamber where Admiral Ackbar orchestrates the entire Rebel fleet from a single command throne. Holographic displays fill the space with tactical data: Imperial positions, rebel assets, hyperspace routes, and the slow dance of fleet movements. Officers work in synchronized precision, each one responsible for a slice of the Alliance's military apparatus. The viewscreens show nothing but the black void of space, yet the weight of responsibility fills the air more densely than any atmosphere. Ackbar's montrals twitch constantly, processing information, calculating odds that shift minute by minute.

    A mile of durasteel and terror cuts through space—the Imperial-class Star Destroyer is the Empire's instrument of absolute authority. From its wedge-shaped bridge, Imperial commanders coordinate the suppression of rebellion across entire sectors. The hangar bays contain dozens of TIE fighters, sleek and deadly. The tractor beam arrays snare fleeing starships like insects in a web. The detention blocks house political prisoners, rebel captives, and dissidents marked for "re-education." The interrogation chambers run day and night, staffed by ISB specialists and torture droids designed to extract secrets from minds before extracting life. Stormtrooper garrisons fill the barracks—anonymous soldiers of the New Order, each one identical, each one deadly. To be captured and brought aboard a Star Destroyer is to disappear into the machine of the Empire. Escape is nearly impossible. Survival itself becomes an act of rebellion.

    Deep in the Star Destroyer's bowels, the detention block awaits political prisoners, Rebel captives, and other subjects of Imperial interest. Carbon-reinforced walls contain energy-shielded cells the size of coffins. Interrogation rooms are soundproofed and equipped with every device the Empire's sadism could engineer. Prisoners are kept deliberately disoriented—no day/night cycle, meals at random intervals, isolation broken by sudden interrogation sessions. The walls echo with screams that no one else can hear. An ISB agent named Bravis oversees the block, a clinical specialist in "information extraction." He views prisoners as puzzles to be solved, information to be mined. The moment a prisoner has given everything they know, they're executed and replaced with the next asset requiring ISB attention.

    The Emperor's ultimate symbol of order—a moon-sized battle station whose surface is a patchwork of weapon turrets, shield generators, and tractor beam arrays. The Death Star's superlaser is capable of destroying entire worlds in a single shot, turning populated planets into cosmic dust. Grand Moff Tarkin commands the station with absolute authority, enforcing discipline through fear and executing officers who disappoint him. The station's interior is a nightmare of scale—detention levels, thermal tractor controls, targeting computers managing a firepower that surpasses entire rebel fleets. The first Death Star fell at Yavin, a catastrophic failure of Imperial engineering that nearly broke the Emperor's iron grip. But the second takes shape in secret, a monument to the Empire's boundless resources and the Rebellion's impossible task. To be assigned to the Death Star is to live in the shadow of potential execution—one mistake, one moment of insufficient loyalty, and a single blaster bolt erases you from the galaxy's memory. The station itself is a fortress that can't be conquered conventionally. It can only be destroyed from within.

    Occupied worlds live under the garrison: checkpoints at every spaceport, curfews enforced by automated systems, and the constant presence of stormtroopers and AT-ATs stalking the streets. Garrison commanders run their territory with iron-fisted bureaucracy—every citizen registered, every movement tracked, every whispered rumor reported to ISB liaisons. The garrison itself is a fortress of prefabricated Imperial architecture: shield generators, patrol flyers, detention cells, and armory bunkers. Local resistance simmers in the streets of occupied cities, expressed through small acts of defiance—graffiti, sabotage, harboring fugitives. The garrison commander knows the resistance exists but can't crush it without destroying the world's economic productivity. It's a slow, brutal occupation that grinds down both occupiers and occupied until only compliance remains.

Pilots, smugglers, bounty hunters, refugees, and fugitives pack the smoke-filled common room, barely acknowledging each other through mutual agreement not to ask questions. The music is discordant and loud, drowning out conversations that could get people killed if overheard. The Empire rarely bothers with the Outer Rim's cantinas, which makes them the Rebellion's unofficial recruiting grounds and the ISB's unofficial hunting grounds. The bartender knows everyone's business and tells no one—an arrangement that has kept him alive longer than most in a business measured in graveyards. Duels are fought in the dust outside when deals go bad. No droids, no questions, no guarantees.

The right contact in a smuggler's den can move anything: weapons, spice, refugees, stolen Imperial tech, or classified intelligence. The wrong word or betrayed trust gets you sold to the ISB, left to die in the desert, or worse—turned loose with a price on your head. Trust is a commodity more valuable than credits, and it's earned in blood and silence.

  description: |
    Twin suns glare down on endless dunes of sand that stretch to the horizon in every direction—Tatooine is the galaxy's back door, forgotten by the Senate, ignored by the Fleet. The rule of law has never reached here; instead, Jabba the Hutt commands through absolute power, trade guilds, and the certainty that crossing a Hutt means death in the slowest way possible. Moisture farmers scrape survival from the harsh soil. Jawas scavenge the junk heaps of dead technology. Tusken Raiders claim the deep desert as their territory. Spaceport cities like Mos Eisley and Mos Tatooine serve as gathering points for smugglers, refugees, and anyone the Core Worlds has forgotten. The Empire maintains a garrison but rarely ventures into the deep desert—Tatooine's hostility to outsiders applies equally to stormtroopers. It's a place where the Rebellion can hide, recruit, and forge temporary alliances with crime bosses and nomads.

    Scattered homesteads and communal cisterns dot the desert, where moisture farmers extract water from the air to trade for supplies. The settlements are isolated and self-reliant, connected to the greater economy only through the occasional spice merchant or moisture broker. Luke Skywalker grew up in a place like this—watching binary sunsets while dreaming of a larger galaxy. The settlements are havens for those escaping civilization, but also vulnerable to Imperial pressure and Hutt exploitation. A Rebel cell hiding here would find sympathetic locals but limited resources.

    Jabba the Hutt's fortress rises from the rocky wastes like a malevolent slug—a sprawling palace of chambers, guard rooms, and throne halls where the Hutt king dispenses law, collects debts, and commits atrocities. The air is thick with incense and the stench of decadence. Jabba's main chamber is dominated by his throne, a sunken platform where the massive Hutt presides over his court like a bloated deity. Slave dancers and musicians provide constant entertainment. The Rancor pit lurks beneath the palace floor—a feeding ground where Jabba disposes of those who fail him. Debts are collected here; favors are traded; the Empire itself bows to Jabba's authority in the Outer Rim. Crossing the Hutt means a one-way trip to the Great Pit of Carkoon or something worse—death by Hutt imagination. The palace is a fortress defended by Gamorrean guards, elite bounty hunters on contract, and the absolute certainty that Jabba has suffered no assassination attempts in decades because he's too deadly to risk. To enter Jabba's Palace is to walk into the mouth of a predator. Many have entered. Few have left.

    A gaping chasm in the desert where the Sarlacc dwells—a creature of legend and nightmare. Jabba uses the pit as his ultimate tool of justice, a spectacle designed to humiliate and eliminate his enemies. Victims are pushed into the pit and slowly digested over a thousand years—a death so prolonged that pain becomes existence. The pit's edge is where Jabba conducts public executions, gathering his court to watch victims scream and disappear into the maw of a creature so vast it makes Hutts look small. To be sentenced to the Pit is worse than any other death imaginable.

    Imperial patrols stomp down cracked streets in perfect formation, stormtrooper boots echoing off tenement walls. Checkpoints are posted every few blocks, staffed by bored Imperial officers who check credentials and search for contraband with brutal efficiency. Surveillance cameras track movement from rooftops. Informants lurk in shadows, paid in credits to report suspicious activity. Citizens keep their heads down, avoid eye contact with stormtroopers, and speak only in whispers about the resistance that operates in the streets after curfew. One wrong glance, one whispered rumor, and the stormtroopers kick in the door at midnight, dragging out the guilty and sometimes the innocent. The occupation is total and suffocating—there is no privacy, no freedom, only compliance or disappearance.

Haggling is a way of life, and the stench of roasted meat, incense, and unwashed alien hide mingles in the thick desert air. Markets are where intelligence changes hands, where rebels recruit sympathizers, where the ISB plants false information to catch spies. The biggest markets attract offworld buyers and sellers, creating temporary safe havens where Imperial authority holds less sway. A trained operative can vanish into a market's chaos; a novice gets caught within minutes. The markets are neutral ground only as long as no one brings their war into the open—the moment blood spills, the ISB appears and everyone disappears.

    A safe house is never safe for long. These compartmentalized safe houses operate in apartments, warehouses, and holy cities like Jedha—where the Empire's grip is cruel but divided attention allows resistance cells to breathe. The safe house is furnished with basic supplies: a radio, false credentials, weapons caches, and emergency escape routes. Rebel operatives sleep here in shifts, always alert for Imperial raids. Local sympathizers—dockworkers, merchants, religious figures—provide cover and supplies. The Alliance maintains dozens of these houses across the galaxy, each one a potential way station for fugitives and rebels on the run. But they're also honey pots: the ISB knows most of them exist and uses them to catch rebel networks. Operatives are trained to burn a safe house—destroy evidence, kill witnesses, ensure their side survives—if Imperial forces approach. The Rebellion can rebuild safe houses. Dead agents stay dead.

    Where rebels and dissidents are broken. The Imperial Security Bureau runs detention centers across the Core—hidden facilities where interrogation, re-education, and disappearance are the only certainties. No trial, no record, only the absolute fact that someone talked. The facility is disguised as an ordinary government building, its interrogation rooms soundproofed beyond detection. The ISB uses psychological torture perfected across decades: isolation, randomized rewards and punishments, false hope of release, threats to families. The agents are professionals, cold and methodical. They understand that information has a shelf life—eventually, you know everything your prisoner knows, and then they become waste to be disposed of. Escape from a black site is nearly impossible. The few who have escaped usually don't survive long after—the ISB doesn't allow loose ends.

    Loading bays overflow with cargo containers, customs inspectors shuffle through manifests, and the grey zone where legitimate cargo meets contraband plays host to profit and corruption. Imperial patrols and Hutt enforcers both want a cut of what moves through the docks. Dockworkers and pilots know exactly who to bribe and who to avoid. The docks are a place of hard deals: a cargo container of spice can be sold three times over before it arrives at its destination, refugees hidden in cargo hold compartments, weapons smuggled past customs officials, intelligence traded for passage off-world. The ISB watches the docks constantly, but there's too much commerce to control everything. A skilled operator can move goods and people through the docks if they know the right contacts and understand when to disappear.

Black Sun controls trade and runs protection rackets with deadly efficiency. Hutt enforcers collect debts through violence and intimidation. Refugees from a hundred worlds scrape survival from the shadows. Imperial surveillance overlooks these depths—patrol droids rarely venture this far below, and cops and officials have been paid to look the other way. The Underworld is where smugglers, fugitives, and Rebels find temporary sanctuary in the maze of duracrete and despair. But the safety is illusory—Xizor's Black Sun has eyes everywhere, and the ISB maintains informant networks even here. The Underworld is dangerous because it's lawless—no one can protect you if you fall, and trust is purchased in blood.

Lando Calrissian administers the colony with style and ruthlessness, maintaining the fiction of autonomy while serving Imperial interests under duress. By day, Cloud City's luxury casinos and floating gardens are the envy of the galaxy, attracting spice merchants, refugees, and criminals with credits to spend. By night, Imperial stormtroopers patrol the lower levels, and interrogation chambers hidden below the luxury suites run their dark business. Vader arrived and turned the city inside out—now it's a base of operations for Death Squadron. Calrissian walks a razor's edge: his people have been betrayed, his reputation ruined, but he survives by proving his utility to the Empire. The city remains beautiful and terrible, a monument to what happens when someone's home is conquered without their consent.

No traders visit. No one comes to Dagobah by accident—only those who have been guided arrive. The swamp is itself alive, conscious in ways the galaxy has forgotten, and it destroys the weak while teaching the strong. It is the antithesis of the Empire's order—pure chaos and mystery, beyond comprehension and control.

Palpatine rules from these halls, his will enforced by Vader and the entire apparatus of Imperial might. The palace is a fortress beyond fortresses—tractor beams, shield generators, legions of soldiers, and the Emperor's own power. To penetrate the palace is to attempt the impossible, and those who try typically die in the attempt. Only the most desperate or the most powerful dare to challenge the Emperor in his own seat of power.

To survive Ord Mantell, you must be fast, deadly, and willing to kill for credits. The Guild maintains order through reputation and the certainty that broken codes result in guild execution—swift, public, and absolute.

The Bothans don't take sides officially—they sell information to anyone with credits—but they've developed a long-term partnership with the Rebellion because the Alliance pays better and the ISB is too dangerous to cross repeatedly. "Many Bothans died" is more than a phrase; it's the price of every Death Star plan, every Imperial convoy schedule, every assassination that changes the course of the war. The Spynet is run by Borsk Fey'lya, a cunning politician who balances Bothan interests with Alliance needs.

  description: |
    The galaxy's most notorious prison labor camp—spice miners work until they die under the lash, buried in tunnels where starlight is a memory. Criminals, political prisoners, and Wookiee slaves sweat and break rocks and collapse from exhaustion. The Empire tolerates the Hutt Cartel's control because Kessel's spice production is profitable and rebels disappear into those tunnels never to surface. Imperial convicts and Rebel captives are sent to Kessel when the Empire wants them to die slowly, remembered by no one. The Kessel Run—a hyperspace route that cuts through asteroid fields and other hazards—is the only escape route, requiring a ship fast enough to complete the run in less than 15 parsecs. Thousands have tried to escape through the Run. Most died in the attempt.

  description: |
    A world of witches and warriors—Dathomir is isolated and hostile to outsiders. The Nightsisters wield the Dark Side through blood magic that predates the Sith by millennia. Nightbrothers serve as champions and slaves. The clans are matriarchal, ruthless, and entirely independent of the Empire's authority. Palpatine himself respects Dathomir's autonomy—the dangers of its forests and its people are too great to warrant conquest. The clans remain mysterious and dangerous, steeped in Force traditions older than the Jedi Order. A Rebel making contact with Dathomir might secure allies, but the price would be steep and the bargain binding.

    A frontier world caught between the Empire and the unknown—Bakura's government maintains nominal independence but is occupied by Imperial forces. The Ssi-ruuk Imperium lurks just beyond the Outer Rim, creating a three-way power struggle: Imperial occupation, alien invasion threats, and the Bakurans themselves seeking Alliance support. The planet is diplomatically sensitive because it could swing the balance of power in the Outer Rim if the Alliance secures it, yet it could also fall to the Ssi-ruuk if the Empire withdraws. The Bakuran Senate is divided between Imperial loyalists, resistance fighters, and neutrals hoping to play all sides. The Truce at Bakura tests whether Rebels and Imperials can cooperate against external threats—a moment of history that could change the war's trajectory.

    Boba Fett's Firespray-31 patrol craft is the most feared starship in the underworld—a weapons platform and mobile prison combined.

Tracking systems ensure no target escapes once marked. When Slave I appears on a target's sensors, the hunt is over. Fett has never lost a bounty, and his reputation keeps him employed by the Empire, the Hutts, and private interests willing to pay astronomical fees. The ship itself is a machine of death and profit.

    The Rebellion's field hospital—a converted EF76 Nebulon-B frigate crammed with bacta tanks, surgical bays, and medics working eighteen-hour shifts to save lives. Wounded pilots recovering from combat trauma rest in cramped quarters. Soldiers with burns and blaster wounds receive treatment. Interrogated prisoners occasionally receive medical care before being transferred elsewhere. The frigate is technically a non-combatant vessel by galactic treaty, but the Empire rarely honors treaties. A medical frigate is vulnerable, slow, and packed with supplies the Empire would love to capture. The crew knows they're mobile targets, and every jump to hyperspace might be their last.

    The polluted throne world of the Hutts rises from toxic swamps where industrial poison leaks into the water and air. Massive palaces loom from the muck, each one a fortress of a different Hutt Kajidic (clan). The largest palace houses the informal Hutt Council, where clans negotiate spice routes, slavery contracts, and territorial wars. Nal Hutta is absolutely sovereign—the Empire tolerates it, the Rebellion courts it carefully, and smugglers worship at its feet because commerce flows through Hutt territory. To cross a Hutt here is to commit suicide in the slowest, most creative way possible. The Cartel's power is derived from economic control, not military might—the Hutts understand that credits are more powerful than blasters.

The second Death Star orbits above, invulnerable as long as the shield remains active. Patrols of AT-STs stomp through the forest on mechanical legs, unaware that primitive warriors sharpening spears and stones are the Empire's ultimate doom. The Ewoks are first contact races never conquered by the Empire because their world was deemed unimportant. That assessment will prove catastrophic. The forest itself is an obstacle—thick vegetation obscures sensor systems, primitive traps work as well as blaster technology against unprepared troops, and the sheer weight of organic life makes military operations difficult. Endor will become the moment when the Rebellion finally wins.

The Rebellion's old command centers now house kath hounds and memories of operations past. The Empire knows about Dantooine ("too remote for an effective base," Tarkin dismissed it), so it isn't heavily monitored. Scavengers and archaeologists still pick through the ruins. The Rebellion occasionally uses Dantooine as a waypoint, knowing the Empire won't invest resources to occupy the Rim too aggressively. But the planet is haunted—every rebel who walks those ruins wonders about the Jedi who died there, and whether the current war might end the same way.

The facility is protected by orbital shields that can only be lowered from within, making it impregnable from space. The planet itself is beautiful: white-sand beaches, crystal waters, and lush jungle. Yet Imperial troops patrol the beaches in full armor, and the facility is disguised as a resort to prevent detection. The Rebellion's desperate assault on Scarif will cost them dearly but will deliver them the Death Star plans they need to strike back. The Citadel represents everything about Imperial arrogance—they believe their technological advantage and security measures make them untouchable.

The camp's commandant runs it with cold efficiency: just enough food to keep workers productive, just enough violence to maintain order, just enough hope that new arrivals cooperate. A successful breakout from Wobani would be a psychological victory for the Rebellion.

The Rebellion uses Felucia to hide rebel cells—the Empire's armor and technology are nearly useless in the jungle, and local guides can navigate routes that Imperial troops cannot follow.

  description: |
    The homeworld of the Wookiees—a massive forest of giant wroshyr trees and sophisticated civilizations living in the canopy. The Empire has enslaved much of the Wookiee population, forcing them into labor camps and military service. Kashyyyk remains a stronghold of resistance, but Imperial forces are entrenched. Chewbacca and other free Wookiees are hunted as fugitives. The forest itself is a fortress—the Wookiees understand the terrain in ways Imperial troops never will, and the thick vegetation makes conventional warfare nearly impossible. A Rebel alliance with the Wookiees could provide powerful warriors and resources, but the cost would be high.

  description: |
    The factory planet of the Separatists, now abandoned after the Clone Wars. The surface is scarred by battle, the factories silent, the skies empty of droids. The Jedi fought their first battles here, and the echoes of that war still haunt the planet. The Empire maintains a presence but the planet holds little value. Rebel cells sometimes use Geonosis to study clone trooper technology and search for salvage. The ruins are dangerous—unstable structures, automated defense systems still active, and the psychological weight of so much death.

  description: |
    A port facility specializing in spice distribution and smuggling operations—less well-known than Mos Eisley but more actively used for contraband. Siccanat is where spice shipments are broken into smaller lots for distribution across the Outer Rim. The port is controlled by underworld interests, with minimal Imperial presence by mutual agreement. The Rebellion uses Siccanat for smuggling weapons and supplies into occupied territories.

    A volcanic fortress constructed on a planet of fire and lava—a stronghold of the Sith hidden from the galaxy. Vader maintains a castle here, a place of meditation and absolute power. The fortress is ancient, predating the current Sith dynasty, and filled with artifacts of the Dark Side. To approach Mustafar is to invite destruction—Vader has made it clear that the planet is his domain and intruders will be obliterated. The Rebellion would never dare assault Mustafar, but rumors of Sith artifacts and knowledge drive some toward foolish attempts at reconnaissance.

    Hidden beneath Bothawui's cities, the Bothan Spy Network maintains an underground network of safe houses, intelligence centers, and communication relays. The network is self-sustaining and compartmentalized—no single cell knows the full scope of operations. Bothans are master infiltrators and intelligence operatives, making the network nearly impossible for ISB to compromise. The Rebellion relies on the Bothan network for real-time intelligence, asset placement, and the movement of high-value fugitives. The Bothans, in turn, profit from the arrangement and use rebel resources to advance their own agendas.

    The Imperial Academy on Carida trains the Empire's elite—officers destined for command positions across the galaxy. The academy is a fortress itself, protected by orbital shields and garrison troops. Cadets are brutalized and indoctrinated, transformed from idealistic youths into cold Imperial servants. The academy is a symbol of the Empire's industrial military complex. Rebels occasionally attempt to extract sympathetic cadets, but security is tight. An inside agent at the Academy would be invaluable—an asset the Rebellion pursues with quiet intensity.

  description: |
    A monastery dedicated to peaceful spiritual practice, removed from the politics of the war. The monks maintain strict neutrality, offering sanctuary to refugees and wounded regardless of faction. The Empire respects the monastery's neutrality because it serves their interests to have a neutral ground where different factions can negotiate without direct conflict. Rebels sometimes use the monastery as a meeting ground, knowing the Empire won't openly violate the sanctuary. The monks are respected across all sides, making them valuable intermediaries.

The station is lightly staffed and rarely visited by Imperial forces. The Rebellion uses Nkllon as a waypoint for supply shipments and repair operations. The isolation makes it valuable, but the harsh environment is deadly to the unprepared.

The Rebellion supports the Twi'lek resistance with weapons and training, making Ryloth a contested zone where insurgency and Imperial suppression play out daily. The Twi'leks are natural warriors, and their connection to the land gives them advantages the Empire struggles to overcome.
