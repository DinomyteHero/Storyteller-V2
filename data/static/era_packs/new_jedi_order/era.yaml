metadata:
  display_name: The New Jedi Order Era
  time_period: 25-29 ABY (Legends)
  calendar_note: The Yuuzhan Vong War period in Legends continuity.
  summary: A living weapon from beyond the galaxy has arrived. The Yuuzhan Vong carve
    through known space with biotechnology the Jedi cannot easily read through the
    Force. Worlds burn, refugees flood safe sectors, and old rivalries collapse under
    existential threat. The New Jedi Order must redefine duty, sacrifice, and unity
    to survive a war unlike any before it.
  tone: Apocalyptic pressure; moral trials; resilient defiance.
  key_conflicts:
  - Galactic Alliance coalition warfare vs. Yuuzhan Vong crusade.
  - Jedi doctrine under an enemy resistant to traditional Force perception.
  - Security hardliners vs. civil liberties during total war.
  themes:
  - Faith and adaptation in the face of the unknown.
  - Unity across cultures during existential crisis.
  - What must be preserved when everything else is negotiable.
