  summary: |
    An enemy from beyond the galaxy has come. The Yuuzhan Vong—warriors who reject
    technology in favor of living ships, who cannot be felt in the Force, who worship
    pain and sacrifice—sweep through the Outer Rim and drive toward the Core. The New
    Republic, riven by politics and denial, is unprepared. The Jedi, hated as
    "Jeedai" and hunted by voxyn and Warmasters, must fight an enemy the Force cannot
    foresee. Coruscant falls and is transformed into Yuuzhan'tar, a jungle cathedral
    to the Vong gods. Refugees flee to Mon Calamari and the Imperial Remnant; the
    Peace Brigade betrays Jedi and civilians for Vong favor. Luke Skywalker's order
    is tested by loss, philosophy, and the temptation of the dark side. This is the
    New Jedi Order: existential war, moral ambiguity, and the question of whether
    victory can be won without losing what the galaxy stands for.
  tone: "Apocalyptic; morally grey; species-level threat; Jedi under trial; refugees and collaborators."
  key_conflicts:
    - "Galaxy vs. Yuuzhan Vong: biotech invasion, worldship fleets, and religious fanaticism."
    - "Jedi as targets: voxyn, Peace Brigade, and the struggle to sense the Vong."
    - "Republic fragmentation: Coruscant lost; Mon Calamari as capital; Imperial alliance."
  themes:
    - "Survival versus principle: how far to go against an existential enemy."
    - "The Force and the Other: the Vong's absence from the Force and Vergere's teachings."
    - "Unity in crisis: New Republic, Imperial Remnant, and Jedi forced into alliance."
