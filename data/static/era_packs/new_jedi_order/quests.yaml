  title: Recover the Lost Jedi Archives
  faction_ids: [jedi_order, new_republic]
  difficulty: extreme
  description: "A Jedi Archive vault was hidden on a Vong-conquered world before the occupation. Retrieve the data crystals containing invaluable Force knowledge before the Vong discover and destroy them."
  objectives:
    - stage: 1
      trigger_condition: Scholar Jen Toras reveals archive location after discussing Coruscant's loss
      description: Locate the hidden archive on a Vong-occupied world. Navigate through occupation forces and infiltrate the sealed underground chamber where the Jedi sealed their knowledge.
      challenge: "Vong patrol routes, environmental hazards, ancient security systems"
      reward:
        reward_type: knowledge
        value: ancient_jedi_force_techniques
      stage_notes: Multiple stealth/combat approaches available. Silent approach gains extra knowledge bonus.
      branches:
        success:
          description: You access the vault; data crystals are intact but heavily shielded
          next_stage: 2
        failure:
          description: Alarms trigger; reinforcements arrive but you secure one data crystal
          next_stage: 2
          consequences: "Limited knowledge gained; Vong alert level increases"

    - stage: 2
      trigger_condition: Successfully accessed archive chamber
      description: |
        The crystals are protected by ancient Force locks. You have three options:
        A) FORCE UNLOCK: Meditate and use Force power to gradually disengage locks (slow, safe, requires Force sensitivity)
        B) PHYSICAL BREACH: Slice/break the locks using technical skill (fast, loud, alerts nearby Vong)
        C) BARGAIN WITH VONG HERETIC: If Vax Kel is with you, he can convince Vong to leave crystals untouched (risky, moral compromise)
      challenge: "Vong reinforcements, ticking time limit, moral choice"
      reward:
        reward_type: influence
        value: jedi_order
      stage_notes: Choice significantly impacts how knowledge is preserved and moral alignment
      branches:

          description: The Force harmonizes with ancient Jedi locks; crystals open safely
          consequences: "Maximum knowledge preserved; Jedi Order respect +15; Force connection deepened"
          next_stage: 3
        physical_breach:
          description: Locks fracture with the slice; data is partial but retrievable
          consequences: "Vong reinforcements arrive within turns; knowledge -30%; must fight/escape"
          next_stage: 3_escape
        vong_bargain:
          description: Vax negotiates with Vong patrol; they allow retrieval in exchange for future cooperation
          consequences: "Full knowledge preserved; Vax Kel loyalty +20; Vong suspicious, will pursue later"
          next_stage: 3_escape_vong_cooperation

    - stage: 3
      trigger_condition: Successfully opened vault
      description: |
        The archive contains a shocking discovery:
        REVELATION: The data crystal labeled "Ancient Prophecy" contains a vision recorded by an Old Republic Jedi—a prophecy describing the Vong invasion with startling accuracy, and claiming there is a "living weapon" that could destroy them.
        You must decide what to do with this knowledge:
        A) REPORT FULLY TO LUKE: Give all information to Jedi Grand Master (increases Jedi trust, but they may act rashly)
        B) RESEARCH FIRST: Hide prophecy from Luke and investigate privately (risks deception discovery, allows deeper exploration)
        C) DESTROY PROPHECY: The knowledge might destabilize the Jedi Order; delete the prophecy data entirely (Jedi trust damaged, but prevents misuse)
      challenge: "Moral complexity, faction trust management, prophecy significance"
      reward:
        reward_type: mixed
        value: "Jedi knowledge + political influence"
      stage_notes: This stage determines the campaign's trajectory regarding Jedi military action
      branches:
        full_report:
          description: Luke receives full prophecy; Jedi mobilize for "living weapon" search
          consequences: "Jedi Order influence +20; Luke respects your honesty; Jedi pursue reckless strategy that costs lives"
          next_stage: 4_jedi_mobilization
        research_hidden:
          description: You investigate privately, discovering the prophecy points to Zonama Sekot
          consequences: "Knowledge +25; when deception discovered, Jedi Order influence -10; Luke angry but war ends faster"
          next_stage: 4_secret_research
        destroy_prophecy:
          description: You destroy the data; the prophecy is lost forever
          consequences: "Jedi Order influence -15; Luke disappointed; prevents prophecy-driven military disaster; mysterious question remains unanswered"
          next_stage: 4_prophecy_destroyed

    - stage: 4_jedi_mobilization
      trigger_condition: Luke learns of prophecy and "living weapon"
      description: |
        Luke launches a massive Jedi expedition to find the "living weapon" mentioned in prophecy. This galvanizes the Jedi but also leads to dangerous military operations.
        MORAL CHOICE: A young Jedi team is sent on a suicide mission based on prophecy interpretation. You discover they won't return unless you intervene.
        A) RESCUE THE TEAM: Risk your own life to save the Jedi (emotional victory, but prophecy research delayed)
        B) CONTINUE PROPHECY RESEARCH: Let them complete their mission; focus on understanding the prophecy yourself (practical, but Jedi suffer heavy casualties)
        C) WARN LUKE OF THE DANGER: Confront Luke that the prophecy is being misinterpreted; sacrifice your credibility to save lives
      challenge: "Tactical sacrifice, loyalty vs. strategic thinking, moral consequences"
      reward:
        reward_type: influence
        value: "Jedi Order + chosen companions"
      stage_notes: This is an unwinnable scenario; some Jedi will die regardless
      branches:
        rescue_team:
          description: You lead dangerous rescue; the Jedi team survives but is traumatized
          consequences: "Rescued Jedi loyalty +30; Luke respects your personal honor; Prophecy research delayed significantly; survivors suffer PTSD"
          next_stage: 5_final_choice
        continue_research:
          description: The Jedi team completes their mission with 40% casualties; you gain crucial prophecy insight
          consequences: "Knowledge +20; Jedi Order influence -10; survivors have lower morale; prophecy breakthrough requires high cost"
          next_stage: 5_final_choice
        warn_luke:
          description: Luke reluctantly admits the prophecy is ambiguous; he calls the mission off but many already died
          consequences: "Luke respect +10; Jedi morale damaged; political credibility -5; fewer total deaths; prophecy research continues carefully"
          next_stage: 5_final_choice

    - stage: 4_secret_research
      trigger_condition: You investigate prophecy independently
      description: |
        Your research leads you to fragmentary historical records pointing to ZONAMA SEKOT—a living planet that created the first hyperdrives. The prophecy suggests the planet itself may be the "weapon" against the Vong.
        You discover an old coordinate to where Zonama Sekot was lost. Following it requires:
        - RESOURCE COST: Fuel, supplies, time away from active war
        - DANGER: The coordinates pass through heavy Vong space; high chance of combat
        - SECRECY: If you tell Luke, he'll attempt it himself and die; if you don't tell him and fail, the Jedi will be furious at the deception
      challenge: "Resource management, hidden research, moral deception"
      reward:
        reward_type: knowledge
        value: "Zonama_Sekot_location"
      stage_notes: This path leads to potential Zonama Sekot discovery—major campaign turning point
      branches:
        pursue_coordinates:
          description: You follow the prophecy coordinates; after dangerous journey, Zonama Sekot is located
          consequences: "Campaign turns toward prophecy fulfillment; Luke eventually learns truth, anger fades when Zonama appears; War outcome dramatically changes"
          next_stage: 5_final_choice_secret
        abandon_search:
          description: The journey seems too dangerous; you report to Luke instead
          consequences: "Merges into full_report path; you've wasted time that mattered"
          next_stage: 4_jedi_mobilization

    - stage: 5_final_choice
      trigger_condition: End of archive quest branches
      description: |
        The archive quest reaches its conclusion. The fate of the Jedi prophecy has been determined by your choices. This final stage represents the CONSEQUENCE REVEAL.
        What you chose matters: Did the prophecy lead to salvation or disaster? Were the Jedi mobilized wisely or recklessly? Was the "living weapon" found?
        THE TRUTH EMERGES: Whether through your actions or others', one fact becomes undeniable: The prophecy was created by Jedi who faced the Vong before—in the OTHER GALAXY. The living weapon is not a thing, but a place: ZONAMA SEKOT.
      challenge: "Narrative closure, faction relationship consequences"
      reward:
        reward_type: story_milestone
        value: "Quest completion + archival knowledge + Jedi relationship status"

          consequences: "Jedi Order influence +30; Force knowledge +40; Campaign success significantly improved"
        compromised_path:
          description: You made practical choices that cost lives but served the greater good
          consequences: "Jedi Order influence +15; Force knowledge +25; Some characters are haunted by losses"
        destructive_path:
          description: Your choices led to greater Jedi losses than necessary
          consequences: "Jedi Order influence -5 to +5 depending on final actions; Force knowledge +10; Hollow victory feeling"
