  summary: |
    The Empire has fallen. The New Republic holds Coruscant and the Core, but the galaxy
    is fractured: Imperial warlords cling to sectors, the Senate bickers, and Luke
    Skywalker's newborn Jedi Order trains in the shadows of the Great Temple on Yavin 4.
    Then Grand Admiral Thrawn returns from the Unknown Regions—a tactical genius who
    studies his enemies through their art and culture—and the Imperial Remnant finds
    a soul. With cloned soldiers, Noghri assassins, and the mad clone-Jedi Joruus
    C'baoth, Thrawn threatens to strangle the Republic before it finds its feet.
    Smugglers like Talon Karrde and former Emperor's Hands like Mara Jade navigate
    the grey between; Black Sun and other syndicates rebuild in the underworld. This
    is the era of Heir to the Empire: elegant strategy, psychological warfare, and the
    struggle to define what comes after the Rebellion.
  tone: "Political intrigue; military chess; rebirth of the Jedi; moral complexity; Thrawn's cold brilliance."
  key_conflicts:
    - "New Republic vs. Imperial Remnant: Thrawn's campaigns and Pellaeon's loyalty."
    - "Jedi Order reborn: Luke's academy, lost lore, and dark side clones (C'baoth)."
    - "Criminal resurgence: Black Sun, Smugglers' Alliance, and the information war."
  themes:
    - "What replaces the Empire: democracy, bureaucracy, and the cost of victory."
    - "Art and culture as weapons: Thrawn's use of psychology and alien minds."
    - "Legacy of Palpatine: Mount Tantiss, clones, and the Emperor's long shadow."
