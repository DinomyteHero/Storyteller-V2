  time_period: 5-19 ABY (Legends)
  calendar_note: After Endor, before the Yuuzhan Vong invasion.
  summary: The Empire has fallen from its throne but not from the stars. The New Republic
    struggles to govern liberated worlds while Imperial warlords regroup in the shadows.
    Luke Skywalker begins rebuilding the Jedi Order amid political uncertainty and
    old grudges. Intelligence wars, border conflicts, and broken treaties define this
    fragile peace.
  tone: Hard-won optimism; political intrigue; reconstruction under pressure.
  key_conflicts:
  - New Republic governance vs. Imperial remnant insurgencies.
  - Rebuilding the Jedi amid fear, trauma, and ideological fracture.
  - Outer Rim autonomy vs. central authority from Coruscant.
  themes:
  - The cost of rebuilding after total war.
  - Legacy, mentorship, and the burden of institutions.
  - Hope tested by compromise and relapse into extremism.
