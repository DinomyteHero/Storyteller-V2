      refugee processing, demobilization—and a thousand quiet bargains. The Imperial City is free, but the under-levels
      never were. Every faction has eyes here.

      A vast archive preserving the history of the Old Republic, the Clone Wars, and the Rebellion—building a historical
      record before memory fades. Historians, journalists, and scholars work to document the era's events, interview survivors,
      and create a permanent record. The Archive is contested: some want it to celebrate the Rebellion's sacrifice, others want
      it to judge Imperial crimes, and everyone wants it to support their version of events.

      An active excavation of a pre-Republic temple on a world forgotten by known history. Archaeologists have uncovered
      evidence of an advanced civilization lost to time. The dig is methodical, careful, and guarded by a small security team.
      Rumors suggest the temple holds technology or knowledge that could tip the balance of power—which is why multiple factions
      are watching the site and waiting for an opportunity.
