      A forgotten apartment in the upper levels, behind false walls and a droid-run laundry front. The air is stale; the only light comes from emergency strips. Survivors pass through in silence—no names, no questions. Holocrons and data chips are cached in the walls. Everyone knows it could be burned tomorrow. Trust is the only currency.

      Once a Republic factory zone; now power is sporadic and the streets are patrolled by Imperial sweep teams. Refugees and fugitives hide in the shells of old warehouses. The district is a maze of collapsed walkways and sealed tunnels—perfect for those who know the routes and deadly for those who don't.

      An ancient Force nexus concealed in a mountain grove. No technology; only stone, water, and the echo of the Force. Jedi Masters in exile come here to heal and to teach the last padawans in secret. The place is warded by tradition and obscurity—the Empire has not yet found it, but every visitor knows they might be the last.

      What remains of the great Jedi library is scattered—hidden caches in caves and sealed vaults. Loyalists risk their lives to move holocrons and scrolls before Imperial demolition teams arrive. The air is thick with dust and the weight of lost knowledge. Every volume saved is a act of defiance.
