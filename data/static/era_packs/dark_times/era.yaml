  summary: |
    The Clone Wars have ended in betrayal. Order 66 has turned the Republic's clone armies against the Jedi. The Chancellor has declared himself Emperor, and the Galactic Empire rises on Coruscant. Across the galaxy, surviving Jedi hide in ruins and safe houses, hunted by Inquisitors and the new Imperial machine. Clone troopers become stormtroopers; friends become informants; hope fades into fear. In the shadows, the first resistance cells form—smugglers run refugees to safety, and a few souls dare to preserve what remains of the Jedi legacy. It is an age of trauma, survival, and the slow germination of defiance.
  tone: Darkness rising; betrayal and trauma; survival and hiding; moral collapse; seeds of resistance.
  key_conflicts:
    - "Empire vs. Jedi survivors: purge, Inquisitors, and the hunt for Force-sensitives."
    - "Clone troopers vs. conscience: inhibitor chips, defection, and becoming the new storm."
    - "Early resistance vs. Imperial control: safe houses, smugglers, and preserved knowledge."
  themes:
    - Betrayal and the aftermath of Order 66.
    - Survival at any cost—Jedi in hiding, refugees, and moral compromise.
    - Hope fading and tyranny rising; the birth of future rebellion.
