metadata:
  display_name: The Dark Times
  time_period: 19-0 BBY (Legends)
  calendar_note: From Order 66 to the opening spark of Rebellion.
  summary: The Republic is dead and the Empire rules by fear. Surviving Jedi are hunted,
    clone veterans are discarded, and systems submit under garrisons and surveillance.
    Criminal syndicates and desperate resistance networks thrive in the cracks between
    Imperial crackdowns. Every act of compassion is dangerous, and every witness might
    be an informant.
  tone: Paranoid oppression; clandestine resistance; survival noir.
  key_conflicts:
  - Imperial security state vs. hidden survivors and dissidents.
  - Jedi fugitives vs. Inquisitors and propaganda machinery.
  - Local survival economies vs. extractive military occupation.
  themes:
  - Identity under persecution.
  - Moral courage in small, deniable acts.
  - Memory of the Republic versus normalization of tyranny.
