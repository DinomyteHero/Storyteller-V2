  calendar_note: After the Jedi Civil War and the fall of Darth Malak; the Republic and Jedi Order rebuild while Sith remnants and ancient mysteries stir.
  summary: |
    The galaxy is still reeling from the Jedi Civil War. Revan and Malak fell; the Star Forge is destroyed,
    but the Sith Empire's remnants lurk in the Unknown Regions. The Jedi Order, decimated on Dantooine,
    trains in hidden enclaves and on Coruscant. Ancient Sith tombs on Korriban pulse with dark power.
    Mandalorian clans, Hutts, and smugglers thrive in the margins. Force-wielders—Jedi, Sith, and those
    who walk the line—seek artifacts, prophecies, and forbidden knowledge. It is an age of ancient mystery,
    moral ambiguity, and cosmic stakes: the fate of the galaxy hinges on choices made in the shadows of
    fallen empires.
  tone: Ancient mystery; Force mastery; Sith–Jedi eternal conflict; moral ambiguity; artifact-seeking; prophecy and destiny.
  key_conflicts:
    - "Sith remnants vs. Republic and Jedi: hidden academies, assassins, and ancient Sith lords."
    - "Light vs. Dark: Jedi restoration versus Sith resurgence; Gray Jedi and balance-seekers."
    - "Ancient powers: Rakata ruins, Star Maps, and artifacts that could reshape the galaxy."
  themes:
    - Ancient wisdom and lost civilizations; pre-Sith and pre-Jedi mysteries.
    - Force philosophy: Light, Dark, and the gray path; power and corruption.
    - Moral ambiguity; redemption and fall; prophecy and free will.
    - Artifact-seeking and secret knowledge; cosmic scale of decisions.
