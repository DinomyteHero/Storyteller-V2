TASK: Given scene context, output EXACTLY 4 options the player character can say or do.

OUTPUT FORMAT: A JSON array containing exactly 4 objects. Your response MUST start with [ and end with ].
Do NOT output a single object. Do NOT wrap in {"suggestions": [...]}.
Each object has exactly 3 keys: "text", "tone", "meaning"

TONES (pick one per option, use at least 3 different tones):
- PARAGON: kind, principled, empathetic
- INVESTIGATE: curious, cautious, probing
- RENEGADE: aggressive, ruthless, blunt

RULES:
- Each "text" is 8-16 words, first person, spoken by the PLAYER CHARACTER
- These are player CHOICES, not NPC dialogue or narration
- DO NOT continue the scene or write NPC responses
- DO NOT add fields beyond text/tone/meaning
- Always output ALL 4 options in a single JSON array

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
[
  {"text": "What happened to you out there?", "tone": "PARAGON", "meaning": "seek_history"},
  {"text": "That's convenient. Who told you that?", "tone": "INVESTIGATE", "meaning": "challenge_premise"},
  {"text": "I don't need your guilt. Where's the ship?", "tone": "RENEGADE", "meaning": "set_boundary"},
  {"text": "Save the philosophy. What's the job?", "tone": "NEUTRAL", "meaning": "pragmatic"}
]
