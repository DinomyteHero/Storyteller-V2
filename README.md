# Storyteller AI

A local-first AI-driven KOTOR/Mass Effect-style interactive story engine set in the Star Wars Expanded Universe. The **V2.20** engine features: event-sourced campaigns, a 12-node LangGraph pipeline (with SceneFrame, NarrativeValidator, and SuggestionRefiner), **Ollama-only** per-role LLM config, LLM-powered KOTOR-style dialogue wheel (4 suggestions via SuggestionRefiner), prose-only Narrator, DialogueTurn contract (SceneFrame + NPCUtterance + PlayerResponses), PartyState companion influence system, BanterManager, era pack companions, 4-lane style RAG, and a SvelteKit CYOA UI.

---

## 1. Project Overview

This repo runs an AI story engine where a player creates a campaign (auto-generated via Architect + Biographer with CYOA character creation, or manual), then plays turn-by-turn by choosing from 4 KOTOR-style dialogue options (PARAGON/INVESTIGATE/RENEGADE/ACTION). Each turn flows through a LangGraph pipeline: Router classifies intent, Mechanic resolves actions deterministically, WorldSim simulates off-screen faction movements, CompanionReaction tracks party dynamics with per-companion influence, ArcPlanner manages Hero's Journey pacing, SceneFrame establishes immutable scene context (topic, subtext, NPC agenda, pressure), Director generates scene instructions, Narrator produces prose-only narration (5-8 sentences, max 250 words), and SuggestionRefiner generates scene-aware suggestions using `qwen3:8b`. The DialogueTurn contract (V2.17) provides a canonical output: SceneFrame + NPCUtterance + PlayerResponses.

Lore and style RAG (LanceDB) with 4-lane layered retrieval (Base Star Wars + Era + Genre + Archetype) grounds the narrative. State is persisted in SQLite (event sourcing); vector storage is LanceDB.

---

## 2. Key Features

- **KOTOR/ME Dialogue Wheel**: 4 suggestions per turn with guaranteed tone diversity (PARAGON blue, INVESTIGATE gold, RENEGADE red, NEUTRAL gray). Generated by SuggestionRefiner (`qwen3:8b`) from the Narrator's prose context (V2.16+, feature-flagged via `ENABLE_SUGGESTION_REFINER`).
- **DialogueTurn Contract (V2.17)**: Canonical turn output: SceneFrame + NPCUtterance + PlayerResponses. Eliminates prose-choice drift.
- **Prose-Only Narrator (V2.15)**: Narrator generates only narrative prose (5-8 sentences). No embedded suggestions. Post-processing strips meta-game artifacts and caps at 250 words.
- **V2 Campaign API**: Event-sourced state; `POST /v2/setup/auto` (Architect + Biographer + CYOA backgrounds), `POST /v2/campaigns`, `GET /v2/campaigns/{id}/state`, `POST /v2/campaigns/{id}/turn`, SSE streaming via `GET /v2/campaigns/{id}/turn_stream`.
- **LangGraph Pipeline**: Router → Mechanic → Encounter → WorldSim → CompanionReaction → ArcPlanner → SceneFrame → Director → Narrator → NarrativeValidator → SuggestionRefiner → Commit.
- **Per-Role LLM Config**: `mistral-nemo:latest` for Director/Narrator (quality-critical), `qwen3:4b` for Architect/Biographer/Casting/KG (lightweight), `qwen3:8b` for Mechanic/Ingestion/SuggestionRefiner. Config in `backend/app/config.py`.
- **PartyState & Companion Influence (V2.20)**: Per-companion influence (-100 to +100) with trust/respect/fear axes. Era pack companions with voice profiles, recruitment triggers, and personal quests. BanterManager with safety guards (no banter during combat/stealth/high-pressure).
- **Gender & Pronoun System (V2.8)**: Male/female selection with pronoun injection into Director + Narrator prompts.
- **4-Lane Style RAG (V2.8)**: Base Star Wars (always-on) + Era + Genre + Archetype style retrieval. 15 genre styles, 4 era styles, hero's journey archetype.
- **Starship Acquisition (V2.10)**: No starting ships; earned in-story via quest/purchase/salvage/faction/theft. REST API for starship management.
- **Companion System**: 108 YAML-based companions with species, voice_tags, motivation, speech_quirk, banter_style. 17 banter styles, inter-party tensions, loyalty arcs (STRANGER → ALLY → TRUSTED → LOYAL). V2.20 era pack companions add voice profiles, recruitment triggers, influence triggers, and banter configuration.
- **Living World**: Time-based world simulation. Every action costs in-game time; WorldSim fires on tick boundaries (default 4 hours) with deterministic faction engine, NPC autonomy, and faction memory.
- **Hero's Journey Arc Planner**: Deterministic 4-stage progression (SETUP → RISING → CLIMAX → RESOLUTION) with 12 Hero's Journey beats, content-aware transitions, and era transition support.
- **Genre Triggers**: Automatic genre detection/shifting based on background and location (11 genres: military_tactical, espionage_thriller, space_western, noir_detective, etc.).
- **Episodic Memory**: Long-term keyword-based turn memory with pivotal event detection and recency-weighted recall.
- **Personality Profiles**: 82 voice tag mappings, 46 trait mappings, 30 archetype mappings for NPC characterization in Director/Narrator prompts.
- **Era Packs (Bible)**: Deterministic factions, locations, NPC casts, backgrounds, and namebanks from `data/static/era_packs/`. Modular YAML structure.
- **Knowledge Graph (optional)**: SQLite KG tables populated via `python -m storyteller extract-knowledge`. Runtime context injection for Director/Narrator.
- **Lore RAG**: Hierarchical parent-child chunking (parent ~1024 / child ~256 tokens) via `ingestion/ingest_lore.py`.

---

## 3. Supported Eras

The engine supports **6 fully-implemented Star Wars eras** with unique factions, locations, NPCs, companions, and quests:

- **Age of Rebellion (0-4 ABY)**: Imperial oppression, Rebel Alliance, asymmetric warfare, found family dynamics. 57 locations, 6 backgrounds, 8+ companions.
- **New Republic (5-19 ABY)**: Post-Empire rebuilding, Thrawn's return, Imperial Remnant conflicts, fragile galactic peace. 75 locations, 8 backgrounds.
- **New Jedi Order (25-29 ABY)**: Yuuzhan Vong invasion, extragalactic threat, desperate survival, Jedi rebuilding under siege. 31 locations, 8 backgrounds.
- **Legacy Era (130-138 ABY)**: Darth Krayt's Sith Empire, three-way war (Sith/Jedi/Fel Empire), shattered galaxy, ancient mysteries resurface. 34 locations, 10 backgrounds, 10 companions.
- **The Dark Times (19-0 BBY)**: Jedi Purge, Order 66 aftermath, rise of the Empire, Inquisitors hunting survivors, seeds of rebellion. 40 locations, 5 backgrounds.
- **Knights of the Old Republic (~3954 BBY)**: Ancient Old Republic, eternal Jedi-Sith conflict, Revan's legacy, Mandalorian clans, Force mysteries, artifact-seeking. 7 locations (WIP), 5 backgrounds.

Each era pack includes:
- **Era-specific factions** with hostility matrices and home locations
- **Locations** with security levels, services, access points, and encounter tables
- **NPC casts**: Canonical NPCs (anchors), recurring NPCs (rotating), and procedural templates
- **Backgrounds** with branching CYOA questions for character creation
- **Companions** with voice profiles, recruitment triggers, influence mechanics, and personal quests
- **Quests, rumors, facts, meters** for dynamic storytelling

Era packs are defined in `data/static/era_packs/{era_id}/` as YAML files. Schema reference: `docs/era_pack_schema_reference.md`.

## 4. Architecture

- **Ingestion** → **Retrieval (RAG)** → **Generation (LangGraph + agents)** → **Persistence** → **UI/API**
- **Tech**: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, LangGraph, SQLite (V2 schema via `backend/app/db/migrate.py`), LanceDB (lore_chunks, style_chunks, character_voice_chunks), sentence-transformers embeddings, **Ollama** for LLMs.

## 6. Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Ollama** (for local LLMs): install from https://ollama.com, then pull models:
  ```
  ollama pull mistral-nemo
  ollama pull qwen3:4b
  ollama pull qwen3:8b
  ollama pull nomic-embed-text
  ```

### First-time setup

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Activate venv:
# Windows PowerShell:  .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# Windows CMD:         .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Linux/macOS:         source venv/bin/activate

pip install -e .              # editable install — no PYTHONPATH needed
python -m storyteller setup   # creates data dirs, copies .env, runs health check
```

### Dev mode (one command)

```bash
python -m storyteller dev
```

Starts **Ollama** (if installed), the **FastAPI backend** (port 8000), and the **SvelteKit UI** (port 5173). Press Ctrl+C to stop all.

### Environment variables

See `.env.example` for the full list. Key variables:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `STORYTELLER_DB_PATH` | SQLite path | `./data/storyteller.db` |
| `VECTORDB_PATH` | LanceDB directory | `./data/lancedb` |
| `STORYTELLER_API_URL` | Backend URL for UI | `http://localhost:8000` |
| `STORYTELLER_{ROLE}_MODEL` | Per-role LLM override | see `config.py` |
| `STORYTELLER_DIRECTOR_MODEL` | Director model | `mistral-nemo:latest` |
| `STORYTELLER_NARRATOR_MODEL` | Narrator model | `mistral-nemo:latest` |
| `ERA_PACK_DIR` | Era pack directory | `./data/static/era_packs` |
| `ENABLE_BIBLE_CASTING` | Use Era Pack casting | `1` (on) |
| `ENABLE_PROCEDURAL_NPCS` | Deterministic procedural NPCs | `1` (on) |

---

## 7. How to Play

1. Start backend and UI: `python -m storyteller dev`
2. In the browser (http://localhost:5173): create a campaign with era, background, and gender selection.
3. Read the opening scene and choose from the 4 KOTOR-style dialogue options.
4. Each option has a tone (PARAGON/INVESTIGATE/RENEGADE) that affects companion approval, alignment, and faction reputation.

---

## 8. Tests

```powershell
python -m pytest backend/tests/ -q --tb=short
```

587 tests passing across 48 test files. Key test files: test_ledger, test_director_suggestions, test_companion_deep, test_v2_campaigns, test_dialogue_turn, test_companion_era_pack, test_suggestion_refiner, test_narrative_validator.

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

- **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'**
  Ensure the package is installed: `pip install -e .` from the project root.

- **Lore/style not found or empty**
  Ensure `VECTORDB_PATH` matches the path used for ingestion. Run `python scripts/verify_lore_store.py --db <path>`.

- **Ollama connection errors**
  Start Ollama (`ollama serve`) and pull the models: `ollama pull mistral-nemo && ollama pull qwen3:4b`.

- **SQLite path / migration**
  Apply migrations: `python -m backend.app.db.migrate --db ./data/storyteller.db`.

- **Embedding dimension mismatch**
  Recreate tables: `python scripts/rebuild_lancedb.py --db ./data/lancedb`.

- **First run slow**
  First ingestion or retrieval may download the sentence-transformers model (~80MB).

## Modes: SIM, PASSAGE, HYBRID

The backend now emits a strict `turn_contract` on every turn response. Legacy fields (`narrated_text`, `suggested_actions`) remain for compatibility.

- **SIM**: LangGraph simulation pipeline (deterministic mechanics + narrated resolution).
- **PASSAGE**: Authored branching episode packs loaded from `static/passages/**`.
- **HYBRID**: Passage spine with optional SIM scene triggers via `SIM_SCENE:<template_id>` choice targets.

### TurnContract (example)

```json
{
  "mode": "SIM",
  "campaign_id": "...",
  "turn_id": "..._t12",
  "display_text": "...",
  "scene_goal": "Advance objective",
  "obstacle": "Escalating opposition",
  "stakes": "Mission momentum",
  "outcome": { "category": "PARTIAL" },
  "state_delta": { "time_minutes": 5 },
  "choices": [{ "id": "t12_c1", "label": "Scout", "intent": { "intent_type": "INVESTIGATE", "target_ids": {}, "params": {} }, "risk": "med", "cost": { "time_minutes": 5 } }]
}
```

### New Passage Endpoints

- `POST /v2/campaigns/{id}/start_passage` with `{ "pack_id": "rebellion", "mode": "PASSAGE|HYBRID" }`
- `POST /v2/campaigns/{id}/choose` with `{ "choice_id": "..." }` or `{ "intent": {...} }`

### Run backend + Svelte frontend

Backend:

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000 npm run dev
```

### Debug checklist

- CORS mismatch: set `STORYTELLER_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` and `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
- SSE unavailable: frontend should retry non-stream endpoint.
- Era pack missing: verify `time_period` exists in era packs.
- Passage pack missing: ensure `static/passages/<pack>/episode_01.yml` exists.

### Manual verification smoke flows

1. **SIM mode (3 turns, objective + beats pacing)**
   - Create campaign: `POST /v2/campaigns`
   - Run 3 turns via `POST /v2/campaigns/{id}/turn`
   - Verify each response has `turn_contract` with 2–4 distinct choices, includes `meta.active_objectives`, and `meta.beats_remaining` decrements/reset on transition.

2. **PASSAGE mode (requirements/check branching)**
   - Start passage: `POST /v2/campaigns/{id}/start_passage` with `{"pack_id":"rebellion","mode":"PASSAGE"}`
   - Advance with `POST /v2/campaigns/{id}/choose`
   - Verify choices are gated and deterministic check choices branch to success/fail passages.

3. **HYBRID mode (passage -> sim trigger path)**
   - Start with `mode:"HYBRID"`
   - Select branch that emits `SIM_SCENE:*` in passage pack
   - Verify returned turn contains deterministic outcome and progression remains stable.

### Streaming reliability notes

- `turn_stream` should always emit a final `done` event containing a complete `turn_contract`.
- Frontend play flow retries the non-stream `/turn` endpoint if stream fails or ends without a final contract.
