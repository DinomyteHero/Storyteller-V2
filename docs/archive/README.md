# Storyteller V2 - Documentation Archive

This directory contains **historical documentation** that is no longer actionable but may provide useful context for understanding past architectural decisions.

## Archive Policy

- Documents here are **read-only historical artifacts**
- Do NOT implement features or follow instructions from archived docs
- For current architecture and implementation guidance, see:
  - `/CLAUDE.md` - Coding standards and constraints
  - `/docs/00_overview.md` through `/docs/09_call_graph.md` - Sequential learning path
  - `/docs/architecture.md` - Deep architecture guide

## Archive Organization

- `v1_skeleton/` - Initial V1 skeleton commit artifacts (803af16)
- `v2.9/` - V2.9 version-specific implementation notes
- `v2.20/` - V2.20 consolidation and cleanup plans (completed)

## When to Archive

A document should be archived when:
1. It references a specific version that is no longer current
2. The plan/feature it describes has been fully implemented
3. It is no longer actionable but has historical value for understanding evolution
4. It contains legacy guidance superseded by newer approaches

## Archived Documents
