# docs/archive

This folder stores deprecated or superseded documentation. Files moved here are kept for historical reference but no longer reflect the current implementation.

When archiving a document, prefix the filename with the date it was archived (e.g., `2026-02-03_old_design.md`) and add a brief note at the top of the file explaining why it was archived.
