CHAPTER 1: THE GATHERING STORM

The galaxy was in turmoil. The Legacy of the Force era had begun, and the fragile peace that had existed after the Yuuzhan Vong War was shattering. On Coruscant, the Jedi Council met in emergency session, their faces grave with concern.

Master Luke Skywalker stood before the assembled Jedi, his voice steady but carrying the weight of years of conflict. "The Sith have returned," he announced. "Darth Caedus has emerged, and he threatens everything we've built."

In the Outer Rim, on the planet of Kuat, a young Jedi Knight received a transmission. The message was encrypted, but the urgency was clear. Something was happening that would change the course of galactic history.

CHAPTER 2: SHADOWS OF THE PAST

The Jedi Knight's ship, a modified X-wing, dropped out of hyperspace near the coordinates provided in the transmission. The system was unknown, marked only as a potential Sith stronghold in ancient records.

As the ship approached the planet, sensors detected multiple energy signatures. Something was active on the surface, something that shouldn't be there. The Knight prepared for landing, lightsaber at the ready.

The planet's surface was barren, scarred by ancient battles. Ruins dotted the landscape, remnants of a civilization long forgotten. But in the center of the largest ruin, a structure stood intact - a Sith temple, its dark energy pulsing with malevolent intent.
